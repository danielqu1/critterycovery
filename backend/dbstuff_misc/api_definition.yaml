Effective population size for cheetahs (females in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park) was estimated at 44% of the census population (incorporating variability in lifetime reproductive success: Kelly 2001).

This species is one of the most popular cage-birds on Java, an island famed for its huge bird markets and very high cage-bird ownership. Surveys conducted in July 2014 in three shops in Jakarta found the average unbartered price for the&#160;<em>A. melanopterus</em>&#160;group of species per bird was US$220, the high price indicating the species' scarcity in the wild (Shepherd&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Three <em>A. tricolor</em> were observed for sale in a survey of the bird market in Bandung in September 2016, taken to be an indication of ongoing capture from the wild. Many <em>A. melanopterus </em>are now being captive bred to supply demand since the almost total collapse of the population of that species (Collar <em>et al. </em>2012, Eaton <em>et al. </em>2015), but <em>A. tricolor </em>does not appear to be as desirable.&#160;<span id=\"result_box\" class=\"\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"Das j\u00fcngste Opfer ist das Cikananga Conservation Breeding Center (CCBC) in der N\u00e4he von Sukabumi im Westen Javas.\">Genetic integrity has been lost due to the widespread mixing of the the three subspecies when birds escape (Muchtar and Nurwatha 2001, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), but the observation of an&#160;<em>A. tricolor&#160;</em>x&#160;<em>A. melanopterus&#160;</em>hybrid during the 2016 Bandung survey (S.
