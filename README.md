##Purpose
Our goal is to create a website that will raise awareness for endangered animals and the habitats that they live in. In the past decade alone, almost 500 species have gone extinct, and we wanted to take the first step in raising awareness of those that are close to extinction.

Models
*  Species (40,000) - name, taxonomy, organisms left, region, habitat, diet, behavior, picture
*  Countries (~200) - name, location, population, endangered species in country, wealth
*  Habitats (30-50) - temperature, humidity, region, locations, number of species(diversity)
---
Three questions we will answer using this site:
* Which habitats have the most endangered species?
* Which regions have the most endangered species?
* Which regions have the most diverse habitats?
* Which species are endangered?
