Given that 16.87% were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. foliosquama</span>, this suggests that the abundance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. foliosquama</span> was 6694 individuals (95% CI 4462 \u2013 8953). The total abundance estimate and percent contribution of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. foliosquama</span> was derived from boat transects of the reef flat at high tide. Seven transects were conducted and a total of 83 sea snakes were sighted, of which 14 were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. foliosquama</span> (Guinea and Whiting 2005).

In addition, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A. foliosquama </span>comprised ~50% of sea snakes seen on the reef flat at low tide in the 1990s (Guinea and Whiting 2005).<br/><br/>In 1926, Malcolm Smith obtained ~100 sea snakes from Ashmore Reef, which were collected for him by Malay fishers, presumably at random.

There is a significant difference in bill size between males and females, enabling the species to exploit limited food resources, with both sexes having relatively larger bills than congeners (Donald <em>et al.</em> 2003, Donald and Brooke 2006). A number of desert-dwelling larks have evolved long bills, apparently to aid digging for food in a sandy environment (Donald and Brooke 2006). Flocks have also been observed feeding among rocks close to the sea, and the birds (particularly males) excavate holes in sandy soil to extract the small bulbs of nutsedges <em>Cyperus bulbosus</em> or <em>C. cadamosti</em> (Donald and Brooke 2006). Breeding is erratic and governed by the slight and irregular rains (Hazevoet 1995, Donald <em>et al.</em> 2003). The population changes rapidly in response to rain, which is a prerequisite for breeding, and has fallen to extremely low levels during droughts (Ratcliffe <em>et al.</em> 1999, Donald <em>et al.</em> 2003, Donald and Brooke 2006).

Adult survival appears to be high and the species is thought to be relatively long-lived (Brooke <em>et al.</em> 2012). Breeding success is sometimes very low, due to high predation by the near-endemic gecko <em>Tarentola gigas</em>.

Given the species's sensitivity to drought, long-term desertification in the Cape Verdes is clearly a major threat (Ratcliffe <em>et al.</em> 1999).

Ground-nesting makes the species extremely vulnerable to the potential accidental introduction of rats, cats and dogs brought to the island by fishers (C. J. Hazevoet <em>in litt. </em>1995). The danger of such introductions (and the potential impact of non-native plant introductions) is now exacerbated by increased tourist activity in the Cape Verde Islands. Evidence of cats (Ratcliffe <em>et al.</em> 1999, Donald <em>et al.</em> 2003) and dogs (Donald <em>et al.</em> 2003) on the island was found during surveys in 1998 and 2001 but these populations did not establish themselves and the island is currently mammal-free.

The water was about 50 cm deep, the ground made up of silt, mud and sand, with almost evenly distributed rocks and boulders. Those rocks were densely covered with green filamentous and short brown algae and aufwuchs. The shore was partly made up of riparian grass, partly building up dense vegetation growing in the shallow water or hanging over the surface. The Presa itself is bordered by walls forming a steep bank on the left side and a sandy-grassy shallow beach on the right hand side.&#160;The habitat was partly shaded by huge willow trees (<em>Salix </em>sp.).&#160;<em>Allotoca catarinae </em>was mainly hiding between the rocks or, more often, in the vegetation.

The water had a bad smell and the surface was covered with foam. Downstream river sections might be in slightly better condition due to the cleaning possibilities of riparian vegetation, but suitable habitats might not reach further downstream than the power plant at Charapendo (Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Cupatitzio) and the Presa de Jical\u00e1n (about 7 km south of the most southern known collection site). An expansion of turbid sections of the river can be observed, which will hinder the vision of this carnivorous species and, subsequently, its capacity to hunt for fry.<br/><br/>Besides water pollution, another threat comes from a trout farm in the Parque Nacional \"Barranca del Cupatitzio\" in the headwaters of the Cupatitzio river in Uruap\u00e1n. Rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) are top predators in aquatic systems and escaped individuals constitute a threat for native fish. Though they would not be able to access the R\u00edo Santa B\u00e1rbara due to the above mentioned waterfall, the impact on stocks in the R\u00edo Cupatitzio would be dramatic and lead to a decline."

It has recently been reported in six other streams: one near Paso Pehuenche (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. 2010) and five new sites, three of them near Laguna del Maule and two not connected directly to Laguna del Maule (Caj\u00f3n Lo Aguirre), with a range extension of 14.5 km to the west from the second locality reported in Correa <em>et al</em>. 2013 (Correa <em>et al.</em> 2018). All streams inhabited by the species on&#160;the Argentinean side are crossed by the National Route N. 145 highways (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>However, the known range of this frog remains extremely restricted.

While it is possible that it could also be found in streams in relatively inaccessible areas 8 km north and 3 km east of its current distribution in Argentina, its presence there is so far unverified (V.

In December 2008, the courses of three streams were modified by paving work, with the consequent drying of the original streams and mortality of individuals, including metamorphosed individuals and tadpoles at different developmental stages (<em>c</em>. 25% of the total population). More recently, surveys conducted in January 2016 revealed a lower number of observed individuals, as well as, the absence of individuals in previously occupied ponds because of the trampling and defecation by cattle (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. September 2017). Between March 2017 and January 2018, 88 dehydrated, dead individuals have been recorded along National Route 145 and inside percolating chambers (W. Prado pers. comm. March 2017, V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. February 2018, BIOTA 2018).<br/><br/>Correa <em>et al</em>. (2013) surveyed Chilean sites.

In 2017, 25 adults and a few tadpoles of medium and small sizes were observed in a stream near Paso Pehuenche (Correa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, in the three streams close to Laguna del Maule, no more than 10 adults and/or tadpoles per site were observed (Correa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In the two new sites in Caj\u00f3n Lo Aguirre, over 25 adults, many juveniles and numerous tadpoles of different sizes were observed per site (Correa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Also, the second locality from Correa <em>et al</em>. 2013 was visited and 20 adults and a few tadpoles were observed (Correa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). All sites were explored in 2017, with a sampling effort of up to three hr/site. It is important to note that these observations were made at night, when the activity of the species is greater (D.V\u00e1squez and C. Correa pers. comm. December 2017).<br/><br/>The population is considered to be severely fragmented on the basis that at least 50% of the population is in isolated and fragmented patches and the species has a low capacity for dispersal, assumed from its small size, alleged site fidelity, strong dependence on water, such that it is not possible to move between patches (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. September 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Population genetics analyses were conducted in 2017, at seven sites in Chile (including localities reported in Correa <em>et al</em>. 2013), with a total of 152 non-invasive individual samples (DNA from buccal swabs). Two different genetic markers were used (from both portions of the genome): mitochondrial DNA (control region) and 26 microsatellite fragments (D. V\u00e1squez <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). The mtDNA analysis shows extremely low values of genetic diversity at the intrapopulation level. The mtDNA data show only three haplotypes (variants) and suggest that all known localities of the species in Chile can be considered as one biological population. The microsatellite analysis supports the hypothesis of low genetic diversity at the intrapopulation level found with mitochondrial data and analysis suggest two genetics units, the stream of Caj\u00f3n Lo Aguirre and the streams near the Laguna del Maule and Paso Pehuenche (Correa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;It remains to be assessed whether there is genetic separation between localities in the western Andean slopes (Chile) and eastern Andean slopes (Argentina). Therefore, it is necessary to compare these results with subpopulations of this species in Argentina, and to carry out more explorations to the north and south of their distribution to identify additional subpopulations (D.

The water is transparent, with relatively neutral pH and very high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2010). Because of this strong association with water, the species' area of occupancy is restricted to meadows (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al.</em> 2010), leaving the subpopulations isolated to these patches.<br/><br/>Eggs are laid in clumps, surrounded by a protective jelly, and are very difficult to find (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Studies carried out with marked individuals revealed that the species' larval period&#160;involves at least four winters as tadpoles (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. 2014). Larvae of different cohorts (hatched in different years) coexist at the same microsites (<em>i.e.,</em> ponds or backwater sections of the streams;&#160;Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, 2014). During the summer months tadpoles grow, and during the winter months they overwinter submerged in ice or snow-covered water bodies (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p></p>", 
      "threats": "The paving of the international route (Paso Pehuenche) has led to a drastic population decrease in Argentina. The paving&#160;affected the course of one of the streams in 2008, despite the remediation that was attempted in 2009 (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). The original stream, which was surrounded by wetlands ('<em>vegas'</em>), dried and led to mortality of frogs. The new stream formed in an area without vegetation and is not suitable for colonization of the species&#160;(Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. 2010). This problem has not been resolved. Recent modifications made to the route caused the mortality of at least 88 individuals between March 2017 and January 2018 because chambers that were intended to capture saltwater from the road in order to avoid contamination of the streams also&#160;incidentally&#160;functioned as pit-fall traps for the frogs&#160;(W. Prado pers. comm. March 2017, V.&#160;Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. February 2018, BIOTA 2018). The chambers still remain in place, so unless urgent actions are taken more mortalities are anticipated (V.&#160;Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. September 2017). The paved road is also considered to be a future threat given its potential to modify water quality, particularly in the lower reaches of the streams. Contaminant particles from vehicular transit could reach the highly oxygenated streams via lixiviation or winds (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). In addition, the salt used for snow melting on the road during winter seep into the streams, potentially altering the ionic composition, conductivity and salinity of water (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The area is also impacted by domestic livestock (cows and goats), which trample on swamps and small ponds (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). In January 2016, previously surveyed and occupied ponds that had shown clear waters now appeared murky and polluted, and were no longer inhabited (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. March 2016).&#160;An additional threat factor is posed by tourist waste, as tourists who visit the area leave large amounts of plastic and other non-biodegradable items in the streams, which is especially pronounced after bi-national annual meetings at the international border (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2010). Furthermore, an expected increase in vehicular traffic due to road paving completion is also likely to increase domestic waste in the area (Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. 2010).               <br/><br/>Introduced trout are another potential threat, and this species has now been confirmed in one of the streams in January 2016, where it had not been seen before (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. March 2016). It remains to be seen whether trout feed on frogs or larvae, which if so would be affecting the population directly via predation, in addition to reducing the power of dispersal and consequent reduction in genetic diversity of the species (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. September 2017). Climate change could also be a potential threat to this species, as a change in the hydrological cycle could directly affect the frog population (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2010). However, climate change modelling studies specific to this area still need to be carried out to determine the potential impact of climate change (Corbal\u00e1n&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2010). Taking into account the long larval period, a drastic change in habitat conditions by any of these threats could affect several tadpole generations at the same time (V. Corbal\u00e1n pers. comm. September 2017).<br/><span class=\"mediumtext\"><span class=\"mediumtext\"><br/>Correa <em>et al</em>. (2013) mention that the threats highlighted in Corbal\u00e1n <em>et al</em>. (2010) (pollution by vehicle particle emissions, livestock, alteration of watercourses, natural floods and climate change) may also affect the newly reported Chilean sites. To date, the effects of livestock and the presence of garbage have been verified, which are particularly intense at sites close to the border crossing (Paso Pehuenche), but all sites could be potentially threatened by environmental factors such as natural floods and climate change (C. Correa and D. V\u00e1squez pers. comm. December 2017).<span class=\"mediumtext\"><span class=\"mediumtext\"><br/><span class=\"mediumtext\"><span class=\"mediumtext\"><br/>In Chile, the presence of chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) has now been recorded for this species.&#160;In 2017, 115 samples of skin swab samples from seven sites distributed in streams near Pehuenche International Pass, Laguna del Maule and Lo Aguirre sector were analyzed (D. V\u00e1squez et al. unpubl. data). Of the seven sites, the presence of chytrid fungus was recorded in six of them, with a prevalence of 40.87% of the total of individuals (D. V\u00e1squez <em>et al.</em> unpubl. data). Although it is not known whether there have been chytridiomycosis outbreaks, <em>Bd</em> could be a potential threat given the species\u2019 limited distribution and low genetic variation (see below). It is necessary to supplement with data from the distribution in Argentina, in addition to establishing a monitoring program in the medium and long term (D. V\u00e1squez pers. comm.

This has now resulted in a series of surveys in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Bahia. From 1983 to 1998, the Caratinga Biological Station was the only long-term field station conducting research on this species (Strier and Boubli 2006), but following the PHVA workshop long-term research was also initiated in Esp\u00edrito Santo, Santa Maria do Jetib\u00e1, by the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atl\u00e2ntica (IPEMA) and by the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The use of population viability modelling has been continued since then as a tool for conservation planning for muriquis (Strier 1993/1994; Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a; Brito and Grelle 2006). In 2002, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) set up the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Muriqui (Oliveira<em> et al. </em>2005). <br/><br/>From 2001 to 2003 the Project for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Brazilian Biological Diversity (Projeto de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o Sustent\u00e1vel da Diversidade Biol\u00f3gica Brasileira \u2013 PROBIO), of the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), approved financing three projects for the conservation and management of the northern muriqui. They are coordinated by three NGOs, the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atl\u00e2ntica (IPEMA), the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Biodiversitas, and the Instituto Dr\u00edades. Two important meetings resulted from this, the first in January 2003 in Santa Maria de Jetib\u00e1, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and the second in March 2004 in Belo Horizonte. They provided the information and directives for the elaboration of a management plan for the species (in prep., see Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a).<br/><br/>Currently, there are research programmes on, and conservation initiatives for, muriquis being carried out in six localities, four in Minas Gerais (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala, RPPN Mata do Sossego, and Serra do Brigadeiro and Rio Doce state parks) and two in Esp\u00edrito Santo (Capara\u00f3 National Park and Santa Maria de Jetib\u00e1). These studies and initiatives cover about 90% of the entire population of <em>B. hypoxanthus</em> (see Mendes<em> et al.</em> 2005a). Besides population monitoring and ecological/behavioural studies, research is being carried out on population genetics (Fagundes 2005; Chaves <em>et al. </em>2006), parasite infections and ecology (Stuart and Strier 1995; Pissinatti 2005), and captive breeding, veterinary aspects, nutrition, husbandry and management (Mendes <em>et al. </em>2005a; Pissinatti 2005). Also, some management activities are carried out by researchers in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo States. A successful translocation was done in Minas Gerais, where an isolated female was translocated to RPPN Mata do Sossego. Since then, this female has produced four cubs; one of them is now a reproductive male.<br/><br/>There is a small but promising captive breeding programme for the Southern species - <em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em> (Coimbra- Filho <em>et al.</em> 1993, Pissinatti <em>et al. </em>1998, Pissinatti 2005).<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",

      "geographic_range": "The range of the northern muriqui (<em>B. hypoxanthus</em>) covers the Atlantic forest of the states of Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Bahia, excluding the lowland forests in the extreme south of Bahia and northern Esp\u00edrito Santo (Aguirre 1971, Melo <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mendes <em>et al.</em> 2005a, Melo 2005, Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011). According to Aguirre (1971), the northern limit to its range was probably the Rio Jequiri\u00e7\u00e1 basin, which flows into the Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos, and including the forests of the right bank of the Rio Paragua\u00e7u. The southern limit is more poorly defined, but it probably extended to the Serra da Mantiqueira, in southern Minas Gerais, near to the state boundaries with Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo (Aguirre 1971,Mittermeier <em>et al.</em> 1987, Lemos de S\u00e1 and Glander 1993, Strier and Fonseca 1996\u20131997).<br/><br/>Recently, a single known population in the state of Rio de Janeiro was confirmed in Itatiaia National Park (Cunha<em> et al.</em> 2009, Aximoff 2015). However, the population is already known since the 1990s (Hall 1995), but without assigning a specific status. According to Talebi <em>et al.</em> (2011), Northern Muriqui populations are located mostly in some forest fragments in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, and have been virtually extinct in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands <em>et al.</em> 1995, 2000; Melo <em>et al.</em> 2004). Currently a population of Northern Muriqui was recorded reported from Alto Cariri National Park, located in Guaratinga, Bahia. Another new population was recorded in the Wildlife Refuge Forest of Muriquis, located between the cities of Salto da Divisa and Santa Maria do Salto, both in Minas Gerais, at the border of Bahia State (Melo <em>et al. </em>2004). In addition, to the species\u2019 records from&#160; the Itatiaia National Park at the border of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States, there are unconfirmed reports of its presence in the environment of this protected area, specifically in Maramba (Andr\u00e9 Cunha pers. comm.) and in some municipalities of Minas Gerais, such as Itamonte (Marcelo Passamani pers. comm.). Search for muriquis in the forest is pretty easy because it is the largest primate in the neotropics with a unique long call vocalisation. However, most of the few remaining populations inhabit mountainous areas, which makes the exact definition of some distribution limits extremely difficult (Talebi <em>et al</em>. 2011). Given that there are currently only 13 known remaining populations (Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011) in isolated forest fragments, and considering the virtual extinction of the species in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands <em>et al. </em>1995, 2000) as well as the fact that its historical geographical distribution should cover the Atlantic Forest in those states (with the exception of the lowlands in southern Bahia and northern Esp\u00edrito Santo; Aguirre 1971, Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011.), it appears that the current distribution of the taxon is greatly reduced in relation to its historical occurrence (Mendes <em>et al. </em>2008a, 2008b; Talebi <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition, the local extinction of the species has been confirmed in many localities, including protected areas, such as the Biological Station of Santa Lucia - ES, Biological Station of St. Lawrence - ES, Forest Reserve Two Mouths - ES and Forest Reserve Pedra Azul - ES (Mendes 1991). The extent of its occurrence was estimated at 100,000 km\u00b2&#160;and its occurrence area is 1,870 km\u00b2 (Mendes <em>et al.</em> 2008a, 2008b; Talebi<em> et al</em>. 2011).",

As this forest becomes depleted, pressure on smaller forest reserves is likely to increase (Evans 1997, Kessy 1998). In addition, the harvesting of plants for medicinal purposes may cause some disturbance, clearance of vegetation along powerlines has resulted in the loss of some territories. Introduced species, such as the tree <em>Maesopsis eminii</em>, appear to reduce habitat suitability (Kyonjola and Njilima 2010) as it closes up canopy gaps, the preferred habitat of <em>A. moreaui </em>(A.

      "threats": "Standard anthropogenic perturbations to this species' habitat are the deviation of water currents towards pasture grounds, the periodic vegetation clearing from creeks by communities in order to improve the water supply, the use of pre\u00f1adilla as bait for largemouth bass fishing, the traditional custom of cloth washing in the water in springs, creeks and streams, and the traditional custom also of using aquatic bodies as corridors to move the cattle within the watershed (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2005). The use of the local agave called \"cabuya\" (Cactaceae) for the washing of clothes in the creeks and streams is known to have active chemical substances that kill aquatic fauna, including fish (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2006). <br/> <br/>Overfishing may not have been a problem before the population was fragmented by habitat loss (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2006). The current fragmentation between subpopulations within the Imbakucha basin has been enhanced by the introduction of exotics (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2003). The concentration of <em>A. ubidiai</em> in a few small localities increases its vulnerability and jeopardizes its persistence, as there is lower probability that dispersers successfully reach other refuges, thus hindering a positive effect of migration on the regional population size (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2003). During the recovery of the traditional ecological knowledge it was evident that five of former pre\u00f1adilla habitats were converted into reservoirs for human supply and floriculture, four were transformed into community-washing places, two were dried as a consequence of inappropriate agricultural activities, and one was converted into a religious sanctuary (the cave called \"El Socav\u00f3n\" which traditional knowledge recognized as a former source of pre\u00f1adilla) (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2006). Another former refuge, the Araque spring, was observed in February 2000 to contain the species, but by July of the same year it no longer contained pre\u00f1adilla (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2003). <br/> <br/>In the Imbakucha basin (Proa\u00f1o, Gallopogyo and Quinde), all six anthropogenic perturbations occur in all of the sites (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2006). Approximately 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 38 communities within an area of 150 km\u00b2 have impacted on pre\u00f1adilla habitat and could be a cause of the poor habitat quality (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2006)."

(2005) and&#160;in nine new localities (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Given the isolation of each subpopulation, the population is considered to be severely fragmented, such that there is limited or no dispersal between subpopulations. Nevertheless, Martinazzo <em>et al</em>. (2011) found that the diversity index observed in <em>Atelognathus patagonicus</em> revealed low genetic variability from the lagoons of the Laguna Blanca system.&#160;<br/><br/>During 2010-mid 2016, all subpopulations suffered a new, drastic population decline caused by a prolonged drought, which suppressed reproduction during six years (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2015, M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). Surveys performed in years during the drought did not find any individuals (M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;2011\u20132016). Additionally, the aquatic habitat was severely deteriorated in all lagoons as a consequence of the dramatic drought (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). By mid-2016,&#160;increased precipitation allowed the water levels to slightly recover, however the habitat was still degraded (M.E. Cuello pers. comm.&#160;October 2017). During 2017, surveys&#160;using subaquatic traps&#160;in Laguna Verde revealed densities of tadpoles and frogs&#160;much lower than those&#160;prior to the&#160;drought, <em>c</em>. 1% of the previous relative abundance (postmetamorphic individuals = 0.07 individuals/trap in one night and tadpoles = 0.1 individuals/trap in one night; M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;January 2017). Similar low densities were registered in Laguna Anti\u00f1ir. While this is likely to be the first stage of the recovery period (M.E. Cuello pers. comm.

Three-dimensional complex microhabitats with vegetated and rocky bottoms are key components for the survival of this species, which rarely uses simple, largely exposed microhabitats, such as sandy bottoms or open waters (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2017b).&#160;Individuals are found in areas adjacent to the lagoons where it occurs, in aquatic and terrestrial habitat, although most often in aquatic habitat (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;It is not known from degraded habitats.<br/><br/>The tadpole was described by Cei (1965) and internal oral features described by Wassertsug and Heyer (1988). Cei (1965) mentioned the omnivorous, probably suctorial habit of the tadpoles.&#160;Breeding is seasonal and takes place within lagoons during the spring.&#160;Tadpoles have been found throughout the year (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2014), but only when the lagoons retain water all year.&#160;In permanent lagoons, tadpoles present two strategies: seasonal (short larval period; metamorphs in the same growing season) and overwintering tadpoles (long larval period, tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis the following spring). In temporary lagoons, desiccation appears to exert great pressure, with accelerated larval development,&#160;resulting in short larval periods, between spring and early autumn (Cuello&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Postmetamorphic individuals can exhibit two morphotypes: aquatic and littoral (= terrestrial; Cei and Roig 1968). In permanent lagoons, this frog mainly exhibits the aquatic morphotype, while in temporary lagoons individuals are able to change morphology to both aquatic and terrestrial environments in response to environmental changes (Cei and Roig 1968, Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;The diets of the two morphotypes are completely different, although both are carnivorous (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2006a; 2009c). The most important prey of postmetamorphic individuals in the aquatic environment are amphipods (<em>Hyalella</em>) and Odonata larvae, while in the terrestrial environment the preferred prey are terrestrial insects and arachnids (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b; 2009c).",

However, some breeding sites in this region are likely to remain unknown as winter counts of the population are larger than the number of birds that can currently be accounted for during the breeding season (Hearn 2015a).&#160;A few observations support this assertion, including 52 reported at Xingkai Lake (Lake Khanka) in March 2014 (T.

Two individuals observed over winter 2012\u20132013 in China and South Korea were likely to have been first winter birds (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A drastic decline and range contraction has also occurred in the species's wintering range, with the species ceasing to winter in regular numbers at any site  outside of mainland China as of winter 2010/11.&#160;Within China, the species has declined rapidly too (in the middle and lower Yangtze floodplain counts reduced 99% between 1986-93 and 2010-11 [Wang <em>et al. </em>2017]), and site use is sporadic. Recent peak winter counts have come from several locations, and none in more than a single year. In 2014/15, a peak count of 84 was recorded at Tai Bai Hu, Shandong Province (S.

Recently discovered breeding sites at fishponds in the Yangtze floodplain are under threat from changes in use and drainage, e.g. at Huangpi (near Wuhan, Hubei) around half of the habitat used by breeding Baer\u2019s Pochard in 2014 was lost before the 2015 breeding season (Hearn 2015a, Lu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Wintering sites are also under threat from habitat loss and degradation. Large-scale habitat alteration has taken place in the Yangtze floodplain due to conversion of wetlands for agriculture, resulting in a large area of natural wetland being lost, estimated to be 62% between the 1950s and the 1980s. Candaba Swamp in the Philippines where the species has been recorded in winter as a vagrant is under imminent threat of land conversion (Roberts 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable harvesting, both trapping and poisoning of birds and the collection of eggs, is a major threat faced by many Asian waterbirds. The traditional harvesting of wild animals, including birds, has increased dramatically in the past decade, and is now a major cause of decline for some wild fauna, probably including some waterbird species. Although the scale of this is currently hard to quantify for Baer\u2019s Pochard (as no wide-ranging quantitative assessments have been undertaken), it could be significant, particularly in China where illegal poisoning and trapping of waterbirds is widespread, indiscriminate (MaMing <em>et al.</em> 2012) and continuing to worsen (MaMing&#160;<em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), and the scale of egg collection, whilst unknown, is also probably widespread and highly organised and is also thought to be concentrated in northeast China, within the breeding range of Baer\u2019s Pochard (MaMing&#160;<em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Incidents of the use of poisoned baits have also been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/>Additionally, in several cases, the loss of populations from former important areas have been preceded by low water levels or complete drying up of water bodies (e.g. the loss of the breeding population at Xianghai Reserve and the wintering population at Baiquan wetlands in Wuhan [J. Hornskov<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt.</span> 2005, S. Chowdhury<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt. </span>2010, W. Xin, C. Lei, L. Jinyu and T. Fox <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012]). Development for tourism and recreational watersports pose a threat to the species's habitat (Townshend 2014), particularly&#160;at Hengshui Hu, Henan, China (one of the most important known breeding sites) (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Incidents of hunting by the use of poisoned baits have been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh. which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury<em> et al.</em> 2012). Hybridisation with Ferruginous Duck, <em>Aythya nyroca</em>,&#160;is also a potential threat (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2014, R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;</p><p></p>"

The similarities between <em>C. flaviceps</em> and <em>C. aurita</em> in pelage patterns such as the ear tufts and the skull-like facial mask, ecological adaptations, ontogeny (the infants are extremely similar), vocalizations and clinal variation in overall pelage colour, based this opinion (Coimbra-Filho 1986a,b; Coimbra-Filho <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, Ferrari <em>et al.</em> (1996) rejected the subspecies status of<em> C. flaviceps</em> based on ecological and behavioural studies of groups of <em>C. flaviceps</em> and <em>C. aurita</em>.

They occur in the montane Atlantic coastal forest and forests of the inland plateau, at altitudes up to 1,200 m where dry season temperatures can fall close to freezing (Ferrari <em>et al. </em>1996). They show a preference for disturbed forest, being rare in old growth forest with sparse understoreys (Ferrari 1988; Ferrari and Mendes 1991). There is a natural hybrid zone, with <em>Callithrix aurita, </em>at the Serra do Brigadeiro, Carangola, in south-eastern Minas Gerais (Coimbra-Filho <em>et al. </em>1993; Cosenza 1993; Mendes 1997a; Cosenza and Melo 1998).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex), fungi and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects) (see Ferrari 1988, 1991; Corr\u00eaa<em> et al. </em>2000; Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010a). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of their diet (Coimbra-Filho 1972; Rylands 1984). Nevertheless, <em>C. flaviceps </em>rarely gouge trees in order to stimulate exudate production and feed primarily on exudates already available in the environment (Ferrari 1991; Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010a). They live in extended family groups of 3 to 20 individuals (Alves 1986; Ferrari 1991; Ferrari and Digby 1996; Guimar\u00e3es 1998; Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010a). Reproduction is concentrated at one dominant female, although up to four females can reproduce simultaneously in on group (Ferrari 1991; Guiar\u00e3es 1998; Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010b).<em> C. flaviceps </em>groups present weak territoriality and occupy large home ranges (33.9 -138.3 ha) compared to other congeneric species (Ferrari 1991; Guiar\u00e3es 1998; Hil\u00e1rio 2009).<br/><br/>The ecology and behaviour of <em>C. flaviceps </em>has been studied by Ferrari (1988, 1991, Ferrari and Diego 1992) at the 880 ha Caratinga Biological Station in Minas Gerais. The home range of the group he studied was 35.5 ha. Guimar\u00e3es (1998a, 1998b) also studied the same marmoset group at Caratinga. Latter, Hil\u00e1rio (2009, Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010a) studied the ecology and behavior of a free ranging group at the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (3,589 ha) in Esp\u00edrito Santo.<br/><br/>The dentition of <em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>is less specialized for tree-gouging to obtain gum than it is in <em>C. jacchus </em>and <em>C. penicillata </em>(see Natori 1986). Nevertheless, at Caratinga Biological Station gum is an important part of the diet year round, and largely obtained from sites where it is available without requiring gouging (Ferrari 1988, 1991; Ferrari<em> et al. </em>1996). At Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, however, <em>C. flaviceps </em>feeds predominantly on fungi and small animals, with gum representing only 3% of the group\u2019s diet (Hil\u00e1rio and Ferrari 2010a).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Average weight: 406 g (Rosenberger 1992).", 
      "threats": "<em>Callithrix flaviceps </em>has a restricted range in an area where the forest is extremely fragmented due to expanding agriculture, cattle ranching, tree plantations (Eucalyptus), urbanization, mining and dam construction (Coimbra-Filho 1986a; 1990; Ferrari and Mendes 1991; Mendes and Melo 2007; pers. obs.). The species is also captured live for the local&#160; pet trade.<br/><br/>Mendes and Melo (2007) surveyed forest fragments in the Zona da Mata of the state of Minas Gerais, and recorded the presence of introduced populations of <em>Callithrix jacchus</em>, <em>C. peniciilata</em> and <em>C. geoffroyi</em>, which they believe are displacing <em>C. flaviceps</em>. They recommended awareness campaigns to reduce the habit of releasing marmosets in the forests surrounding the town of Manhua\u00e7\u00fa.<br/>Comparison of census data spanning three generations (2005-2019), a yellow fever epidemic appears to be largely responsible for a 90% population decline in at least one major sub-population (Possamai <em>et al</em>. 2019) and may have impacted others as well (S.

The greater threats to the island\u2019s remaining wet zone habitats are perceived to be from indirect sources exacerbated by \u2018island effects\u2019 resulting from fragmentation\u2014 invasive species, pesticide influx, edge effects, local climate change and rainwater acidification.<br/><br/>Pesticides are a serious concern given that these substances are freely and widely used in Sri Lanka. Regulation presently addresses only human safety issues, and not impacts on other non-target organisms or the environment in general (Anon. 1980). Given that 24 of Sri Lanka\u2019s 49 freshwater crab species are restricted to montane and sub-montane habitats, poor sloping-land management and unwise land-use change in the highlands continues to be a serious problem (Hewawasam <em>et al</em>. 2003). An estimated 292 MT ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of topsoil is lost to erosion from these lands, degrading habitats and increasing silt loads in streams and rivers (ADB 2003).<br/><br/>Even species with wide ranges and apparent tolerance of land-use changes could suffer catastrophic declines as a result of changes, for example, in land developments, hydrology or pesticide-use regimes. For example, the populations of two species of widely-distributed freshwater fishes (<em>Labeo lankae</em> and <em>Macrognathus aral</em>) assessed in 1980 as \"common\" (Senanayake 1980) crashed within a decade, without warning, for reasons still unknown\u2014 they are now presumed extinct (Pethiyagoda 1994)."

Records of the species are patchy and spread widely across the Indo-West Pacific from Oman to China. For the purposes of this assessment, the range was considered \u2013 at least historically \u2013 to be continuous in coastal areas between those locations and thus surveys that occurred across the region were considered for the Records and Survey Model.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The Threats Model (Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017) considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the life history traits that determine the species' susceptibility to these threats. There is a long history of intensive coastal fisheries throughout the tropical Indo-West Pacific and the region includes many of the world\u2019s largest shark fishing nations (including some with Pondicherry Shark records e.g. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan) and global hubs of shark fin trade (e.g. Hong Kong). Intensive and largely unregulated fishing pressure that has driven major declines in sharks across Asia and the Indo-West Pacific more broadly is considered the major threat facing the Pondicherry Shark.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The life history of the Pondicherry Shark is unknown, however the family Carcharhinidae is well-studied. The maximum known size of this species is 102 cm TL and smaller-sized carcharhinids are among some of the faster-growing and biologically productive sharks, although still characterized by low rates of natural mortality and low fecundity. Therefore, the Pondicherry Shark is considered susceptible to population reduction and depletion as a result of threats operating across its range (with little spatial refuge), but not to the degree of many other elasmobranchs. The probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction&#160;<em>P(local)</em>&#160;was very high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0) and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species was similarly high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0). As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00).</p><p>Most records of the species are historic, occurring pre-1960.

The probability that the species was correctly identified since 1960 is moderate-to-low and no specimens could be confirmed since that time. Note that misidentification is a major issue with this specie<a name=\"_Hlk52520711\">s </a>and it is easily confused with a number of other&#160;<em>Carcharhinus</em>&#160;species (for example, recent putative records from Sri Lanka).</p><p>Although the range of the species is extensively covered by fishers who are fishing daily and landing catches locally, passive surveys were set at a low level of coverage given the very wide range of the species; it was assumed that the proportion of the species' range covered was 0.2 (lower = 0.1; upper = 0.3). The probability that the species would have been recorded is very low (lower = 0; best = 0.005; upper = 0.01) because the species is rare, small and therefore of little economic value and is more likely to have gone unnoticed in mixed catches. Similarly, given the high diversity of <em>Carcharhinus</em> sharks in the Indo-West Pacific together with poor local species-specific separation of catches and identification issues with this species, the probability that the taxon could have been reliably identified is also very low (lower = 0; best = 0.005; upper = 0.01).</p><p>Its range has been subject to considerable survey effort directed at sharks and rays in general over the last 30 years, and some dedicated searches for this species, all of which have failed to produce a verified record.

Over-harvest is of particular concern because the Giant Carp is commercially valuable, slow growing, large-bodied and often a  component of mixed stock fisheries in areas of heavy fishing pressure.<br/><br/>It is expected that the development of mainstream dams on the Mekong will lead to further declines in the remaining populations through disruption of the species short-distance migrations and further loss of recruitment, however further research is needed on the migratory patterns of the species."

This apparent biogeographic anomaly, in addition to the lack of any discovery to date of skeletal tortoise remains or other living tortoises on Fernandina, has created some uncertainty as to its relationships.

      "conservation_measures": "The first planned conservation action aimed to increase the survival of Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas was the installation in 1984 of an exclusion fence on the southwestern coastal plain to protect prime nesting areas from egg predation by feral pigs. This structure was in poor condition for over a decade until it was replaced in 2005 by a fence of much higher quality and with a mesh size that excluded pigs yet allowed iguanas to pass through and nest in historic areas. Similar exclusion fences are needed to protect inland forest nesting areas from pigs as well as goats. Fortunately, a well-attended hunting season has kept the feral goat population from expanding and the timing has been moved outside the iguana nesting and incubation seasons (Joglar <em>et al</em>. 2007, M. Garc\u00eda pers. comm.).<br/><br/>An <em>in situ</em> headstart program was initiated in 2000 that boosted recruitment of juvenile iguanas for several years and increased the adult population (Garc\u00eda and Gerber 2016). Despite the success of the headstart program, it was expensive and only meant to serve as a stopgap measure. Since the primary threats to Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas are invasive mammals, the focus is now on planning for their eradication. The first step toward this goal was the completion of a feasibility study to eradicate feral pigs, cats, and rats from Mona Island (Island Conservation 2013). In addition to ecological and logistical challenges, a major hurdle will be securing the estimated 8.2 million US dollars required for this necessary eradication.<br/><br/>Recent efforts to remove Australian Pine and restore iguana nesting habitat have met with initial success (Figuerola <em>et al</em>. 2018). Using chainsaws and rakes to remove all pine needle debris, six areas were cleared providing <em>ca</em> one km<sup>2</sup> of new nesting habitat for iguanas. Ten iguana nests with hatched eggshells were observed in these restored plots from the 2017 nesting season. Additional pine removals and monitoring to ensure against regrowth are planned.<br/><br/>Additional training of law enforcement personnel is needed to ensure protection of the Mona Rhinoceros Iguana. Some education and outreach materials targeting visitors are in place on the island but needs improvement.

Later, P\u00e9rez-Buitrago and Sabat (2000) estimated the population at approximately 5,000 total individuals and inferred a relatively stable population from the differences in survey method. However, both surveys noted a particularly low abundance of juveniles (only 5\u201310% of the population, Weiwandt 1977), as did Moreno who observed only two juveniles among 118 iguanas (1995). This contrasts sharply with unpublished data for the closely related Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas (<em>Cyclura cornuta</em>) on Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic, where all age classes are similarly abundant and juveniles comprise approximately one-third of the population (Grupo Jaragua 1994). Further, the density of iguanas on Petite Gon\u00e2ve Island (Haiti) was 26 times greater than observed for iguanas on Mona (0.3\u20131.4 iguanas/ha, P\u00e9rez-Buitrago <em>et al</em>. 2008). Thus, low iguana densities and the scarcity of juveniles on Mona suggested an ageing and slowly declining population. This is considered to be the result of years of predation on hatchlings and eggs by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) and was later confirmed by research documenting a 22% survival rate for hatchling iguanas during their first five months (P\u00e9rez-Buitrago and Sabat 2007).<br/><br/>Small, short-term improvements to the population were achieved in the early 2000s since a headstart program was initiated that has released 263 iguanas to date, at a size safe from cat predation (Figuerola-Hern\u00e1ndez <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Survival of headstarted iguanas was at least 40% initially and were later observed breeding (Garc\u00eda and Gerber 2016). Although, no current population estimate is available, it is believed the population has slightly increased from surveys in 2000, due to headstarting and other conservation measures. However, today's population size is estimated to be many-fold smaller than that of the 1800s and prior to the introduction of invasive alien species and periods of settlement for mining, agriculture, and fishing (Wiewandt 1977).

Juvenile recruitment is impacted by the combined effects of feral pigs eating incubating eggs and cats preying on hatchlings. These invasive predators must be eradicated in order to solidify the long-term future of the iguana. In addition, removal of the Australian Pine plantation is necessary to restore prime nesting areas. The significant population reduction (&gt;75%) for this species occurred much longer than three generations ago due to the introduction of invasive alien species and periods of settlement for mining, agriculture, and fishing. Some of these threats have not ceased for the remnant population, particularly the impacts of predators.

      "text_habitat": "<p>Mona Island\u2019s climate is a dry subtropical (80 cm rainfall per year) open canopy forest of short, seasonally-deciduous trees, shrubs, cacti, and bromeliads. Rainwater percolates rapidly through the porous limestone substrate, allowing no freshwater streams or ponds. Solution channels and sinkholes that penetrate the island\u2019s rock topography offer underground shelters that are used by both male and female iguanas, and retreats attractive to females are vigorously defended by males. Some males hold territories year-round, while others defend them only during the brief June mating season.<br/><br/>Because more than 95% of Mona\u2019s surface is rock, females must migrate to scarce soil patches for nesting during a two-week, mid-summer season that appears to be cued by photoperiod. Most egg laying (74%) occurs communally in sandy clearings on the island\u2019s southern coastal terraces, with the remaining 26% in sinkhole depressions (Haneke 1995). Mean clutch size is 12 eggs. Surviving eggs hatch approximately 83 days after laying, during the latter half of October. Newly emerged young are large (11.3 cm snout-to-vent length, 74 g) and only the smallest juveniles are susceptible to native predators. Coloration and behaviour of hatchlings suggests that aerial predators have long been a threat to hatchlings (Wiewandt 1977). Males can reach 53 cm in snout-to-vent length (Powell and Glor 2000).<br/><br/>Females are physically able to reproduce at 3.5 years (headstarted), but are more likely to become sexually mature in their fifth to sixth year in the wild. Although longevity records are not available, Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas, like all large rock iguanas, are probably among the longest-lived lizards in the world (&gt;40 years). Generation length is estimated to be 20 years but could be longer. Consequently, populations are slow to recover from losses over time. Mona iguanas are primarily herbivorous, with a strong preference for fruits that fall from native trees. Some animal matter is eagerly eaten, especially caterpillars when available. Trees reach their greatest size and diversity around the edges of scattered sinkhole depressions, areas that are of particular importance to the welfare of the iguana population.</p>", 
      "threats": "The most pressing threat to Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas today is the persistence of invasive alien species introduced to the island much longer ago than three generation lengths of the iguana. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) target nest areas and were noted to consume nearly 100% of the eggs (Wiewandt 1977). Presently, camera traps in unfenced nesting sites also show nearly 100% loss (Figuerola-Hern\u00e1ndez <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are a known and serious predator of hatchlings on Mona as has been observed for other <em>Cyclura</em>. Iverson (1978) documented the devastating impact of cats on a Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana (<em>Cyclura carinata</em>) subpopulation, and there no doubt that the scarcity of juveniles on Mona observed in previous surveys is due almost entirely to the combined impacts of pigs consuming eggs and cats preying on young. Feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) have influenced the structure and composition of Mona\u2019s vegetation (Rojas-Sandoval <em>et al</em>. 2016), particularly in the recovery period after hurricanes, and may threaten iguanas through competition. Goat have also been observed on camera traps trampling communal nest areas. Invasive Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and House Mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) are also established on Mona, although their impact on the iguanas is less well understood.<br/><br/>Most recently, a few invasive Common Green Iguanas (<em>Iguana iguana</em>), which have been established on mainland Puerto Rico in very large numbers, have been detected on Mona Island. Although these have been removed (M. Garcia pers. comm. 2019), this represents a new threat for Mona\u2019s iguanas through resource competition, habitat degradation, and possibly hybridization that has been documented between Sister Island Rock Iguanas (<em>Cyclura nubila caymanensis</em>) and invasive Common Green Iguanas on Little Cayman, Cayman Islands (Moss <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the 1930\u201340s, large areas in the principal iguana nesting grounds along the southwestern terrace were planted with exotic Acajou Mahogany (<em>Swietenia mahagoni</em>) and Australian Pine (<em>Casuarina equisetifolia</em>). These plantations drastically altered the native plant communities, reduced understory vegetation, promotes erosion, and the closed canopy prevents adequate sunlight for iguana egg incubation. Fallen <em>Casuarina</em> needles create a thick five-cm layer over the sand and have eliminated the availability of these areas for nesting (Haneke 1995, Figuerola <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>A significant portion of nesting areas for the Mona Rhinoceros Iguana occur near the coast and in soil depressions. Such areas are particularly prone to flooding during tropical storms and hurricanes, which destroys iguana nests. The Caribbean is predicted to experience significant changes in temperature, precipitation, tropical cyclone activity, and sea level rises due to global climate change (Biasutti <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Although lacking permanent settlements today, Mona is a haven for recreational activities, including camping, fishing, swimming, scuba diving, beach-combing, exploring, and hunting. Most of these activities are concentrated along the island\u2019s sandy coastal terraces and within sinkhole depressions, areas that are of critical importance for iguana nesting. Mona iguanas are wary and easily disturbed while nesting, and visitors can unintentionally disrupt the egg-laying process. People and feral animals walking through nest site clearings during incubation may cause nest chambers to collapse and destroy developing eggs. These and other conflicts between iguanas and visitors are expected to continue as recreational use of the island remains. Mona may have already exceeded its carrying capacity for low-impact tourist visitation. Better supervision over visitors, particularly by strengthening educational programs, will become increasingly important as the number of visitors coming to Mona continues."

Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed.  The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered \u201cisland populations\u201d.  Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek <em>et al</em>. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye <em>et al</em>. 2012; Neuman <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005; Reiners <em>et al</em>. 2014). Agricultural intensification\u2014specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides\u2014are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli <em>et al</em>. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston <em>et al</em>. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke <em>et al</em>. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations."

Geographical barriers, especially mountain systems (such as the eastern Andes, the Merida Cordilleras in the west, the Venezuelan coastal range in the north, and the Guiana shield in the southeast), have also delimited the Orinoco crocodile distribution. Historical data suggests that it has never occurred in the Caroni River Basin (Castro and Gorzula 1986). To date, it is still not clear why the species has never colonized the Atabapo and Casiquiare rivers (likely waterways towards the Amazon basin), remaining an interesting question to be resolved (Medem 1981). However, indigenous communities have reported seeing <em>C. intermedius</em>, including breeding events, in the Casiquiare River (Antelo 2008), raising questions about the presence of the species in this area.<br/><br/>Currently, the Orinoco Crocodile can be found in a small portion of its historical distribution in large rivers such as Arauca, Bita, Cinaruco, Guaviare, Guayabero, Lozada, Meta, Vichada, Orinoco, Casanare, Cusiana, Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte, Cravo Sur, Ariporo (Morales-Betancourt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moreno-Arias <em>et al</em>. 2016, Antelo <em>et al</em>. 2016), Manacacias, Apure, Portuguesa, Tucupido, Cojedes, Manapire, Capanaparo, Ventuari, Caura, Zuata, and some of their tributaries (Gorzula and Mendoza 1993, Arteaga <em>et al</em>. 1996, Antelo 2008, Seijas 2011, Babarro per. comm).

Capanaparo River has faced a population decline of 63% between 2001 and 2011 (Moreno 2012).<br/><br/>Population data from Colombia had been collected using a variety of survey methods (i.e., diurnal or nocturnal counts, and/or aerial surveys), of which several did not report the actual distances surveyed (instead they reported number of individuals/sector or zone). Regardless this disparity, \u201cof concern\u201d data (where zero individuals were sighted) were reported from surveys carried out in La Hermosa and Picapico Creeks (1994 and 2010), Ariporo River (1994 and 1995), Cravo Sur River (1995 and 2010), and Tomo River (1995, 1996, and 1997; Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro <em>et al</em>. 2012). Other areas such as the Cravo Norte (1994\u20131995, 2000\u20132001, 2012), Casanare (1996, 2012), and the Orinoco (1994, 1995) Rivers, as well as the Guanapalo (2010) and Meta (1995, 1996, 1998, 2010, 2011, 2012) River System, have been studied over a 20-year span with relative abundances ranging from 0.0 to 0.81 ind/km (Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro <em>et al</em>. 2012, Barahona and Bonilla 1999, Ardila-Robayo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Rios and Trujillo 2004). The Lipa and Ele Rivers consistently had a low relative abundance value over a 15-year span (0.2 and 0.3 ind/km in 1995 and 2012; 0.3 ind/km in 1995 and 2001; 0.2 ind/km in 2012; Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Anzola and Antelo (2015) reported an increase in populations inhabiting the Lipa, Ele, and Cravo Norte River Systems over a 13 years-span based on nest surveys.<br/><br/>Mature population size estimates done in the 1980s in both Venezuela and Colombia report an overall mature population of ~550 individuals, 273 from Venezuela in the Cojedes (76 individuals), Capanaparo (78 individuals), Meta (67 individuals), Cinaruco (19 individuals), Portuguesa (12 individuals), Orinoco (five individuals), San Carlos (four individuals), Riecito (three individuals), and Tinaco and Guanare (two individuals each) Rivers (Godshalk 1978, 1982) and 280 from Colombia mainly in departments such as the Arauca (180 individuals), Casanare (49 individuals), Meta (14 individuals). and Vichada (37 individuals; Medem 1981). Current studies show a general reduction in these numbers in both Venezuela (Seijas <em>et al</em>. 2010, Espinosa-Blanco and Seijas 2012, Moreno 2012) and Colombia (Lugo-Rugeles 1996), indicating that the situation of the species is worse than previous reports. Lugo-Rugeles (1996) estimated an overall mature population size of 123 individuals in the Lipa, Cuiloto, Ele, Cravo Norte, Santo Domingo, Duda, Lozada, Alto Guayabero, Meta, and Vichada rivers. Historic estimations (before 1980) regarding mature population sizes were not completed across Orinoco Crocodile range. However, Medem (1981) estimated that between 1920 and 1950 a minimum of 254,000 skins from mature animals were exported.<br/><br/>Restocking processes have been highly uneven between Venezuela and Colombia. To date, Venezuela has released into the wild 9,812 individuals in consecutive years between 1990 and 2016 in five states (Apure, Gu\u00e1rico, Barinas, Cojedes, and Portuguesa), with a maximum of 763 individuals released during 2009 and a minimum of 40 during 1990 (Chavez 2002, Babarro 2014). In contrast, even though efforts at restocking in Colombia have not been as vigorous as in Venezuela, it is notable that starting in 2015 two institutions (The Palmarito Foundation and the National University of Colombia) have released a total of 57 individuals in three departments (Casanare, Vichada, and Meta; Antelo 2015, Antelo <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moreno-Arias <em>et al</em>. 2016).",

This threat is understood, but it is currently not ongoing due to national and international legislation blocking any trade of this species (CITES Appendix I). However continuing threats by persecution, habitat loss and the limited number of mature individuals occurring in protected areas constitute continuing concerns for this species. Estimations of mature population sizes were not completed across Orinoco Crocodile range before 1980. However, Medem (1981) estimated that between 1920 and 1950 a minimum of 254,000 skins from mature animals were exported. Mature population size estimates done in the 1980s in both Venezuela and Colombia report an overall mature population of ~550 individuals, 273 from Venezuela and 280 from Colombia. Current studies show a general reduction in these numbers in both Venezuela (Seijas <em>et al</em>. 2010) and Colombia (Lugo 1996), indicating that the situation for the species continues to decline. Lugo (1996) estimated an overall mature population size of 123 individuals in the Lipa, Cuiloto, Ele, Cravo Norte, Santo Domingo, Duda, Lozada, Alto Guayabero, Meta, and Vichada rivers. Currently, the population size is estimated at ~250 mature individuals across its range with the largest population harbouring ~40 mature animals in both Colombia (Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte River System) and Venezuela (Cojedes River System and Capanaparo River). However, population size is not currently possible to be estimated in 17 out of the 34 areas reported with presence of the species (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2017).",

The edges of the reserve itself are under increasing pressure from human encroachment from both the resident population and new communities migrating into the area. The extraction of timber from forest at the reserve edge is widespread, and in some areas so intensive that the forest is completely cleared and subsequently converted to agriculture (C. V\u00e1squez Almaz\u00e1n pers. comm. March 2011). Forests further into the reserve are exploited for ferns and other forest products (C. V\u00e1squez Almaz\u00e1n pers. comm.

The effects of these changes in temperature and humidity are unknown, and there is currently no evidence that climate change is affecting this species (C. V\u00e1squez Almaz\u00e1n pers. comm.

However, the difficulty in finding these animals in drier conditions suggests that this species is highly sensitive to humidity, and as it is wholly reliant on good-quality cloud forest it will be rapidly driven to extinction if climate change modifies this habitat beyond its ability to persist.<br/><br/>The pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus has been detected in this area (C. V\u00e1squez Almaz\u00e1n pers. comm. March 2011), but its effects on these direct-developing salamanders are unknown.&#160;The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, \u201c<em>Bsal</em>\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Guatemala (Guatemala Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019)."

Elsewhere for <em>C. galbinifrons</em>, only anecdotal relative population density data are available. All recent indications are that the species requires extensive search effort to encounter. During field surveys in Lao PDR in 1993\u20131999, encounter rates were at the order of one turtle per three months in the field for a herpetologist, and one <em>C. galbinifrons</em> per day when working with a trained turtle hunting dog in prime turtle habitat (Stuart and Timmins 2000). A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009\u20132012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for <em>C. galbinifrons.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range inferred that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7\u201315 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. Corresponding increases in wholesale prices paid have been documented during interviews throughout the species range in Viet Nam (McCormack, unpubl. data). Whereas <em>C. galbinifrons</em> was observed in substantial quantities in illegal trade shipments in the 1990s and early 2000s, only sporadic animals are observed in recent years, even though hunter interviews indicate that collection effort has not decreased, but the encounter rate has dropped precipitously.

The species is predominantly terrestrial and is not specifically associated with forest streams, though animals can swim relatively well and can be seen, at least in captivity, wallowing in shallow water or swampy areas. It is considered a cool forest turtle, with temperatures exceeding 28\u00baC often resulting in stress and poor incubation success in captive animals (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011, T. McCormack, unpubl. data).&#160;<em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching up to 20 cm carapace length at a weight of about 800 to 1,200 g. Males and females reach about the same size. Hatchlings measure about 45\u201350 mm and weigh 15\u201324 g. Extremely little is known of the biology of <em>C. galbinifrons</em> in the wild; most observations on diet, growth and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity, either within or close to the species\u2019 natural range, or in artificially manipulated captive conditions such as terrariums.<br/><br/>The species appears to be omnivorous; its recorded diet includes bamboo shoots, fruit, earth<span class=\"longtext\">worms, and carrion. <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Research on movement patterns, microhabitat use and other aspects of natural history have been carried out at the population of&#160;Diaoluoshan&#160;in Hainan, China (Wang <em>et al</em>.&#160;2011).&#160;Slow growth to maturity (10\u201315 yrs) is combined with low fecundity; clutch size in the wild in Hainan was 1\u20132, with shelled eggs found in April and oviposition from late May to early July (J.

      "threats": "The primary threat to <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> has been collection for trade. The species continues to be in high demand in the international pet trade and the food trade. Collection efforts include both targeted searches for turtles involving trained dogs, or occasionally pitfall traps, as well as capitalising on casual turtle encounters when collecting other forest products. Turtles, of any species, are collected whenever and wherever encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of local middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. Increasing economic value has ensured that hunting pressure is sustained despite the increasing rarity of the species (Hendrie 2000, Stuart and Timmins 2000, McCormack <em>et al</em>. 2010). Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localised threat to the species (Stuart and Timmins 2000, Hendrie 2000). In China, most of the species range is in protected areas, so habitat loss is not considered a major threat."

The Hellshire Hills is currently part of the Portland Bight Protected Area (PBPA). Declared in 1999, the PBPA is Jamaica\u2019s largest protected area and includes both of the Goat Islands. Designation as a protected area provides a promising legal instrument to prevent the expansion of large-scale development projects in the Hellshire Hills.<br/></p><p>Following the rediscovery of the species in 1990, a local Jamaican Iguana Research and Conservation Group (JIRCG) was formed, comprising representatives from the University of the West Indies, the Natural Resources Conservation Authority, Hope Zoological Gardens, and the Institute of Jamaica. Together with a group of international iguana specialists, the JIRCG held an IUCN-sponsored workshop in Kingston in 1993, which developed a Population and Habitat Viability Assessment and a comprehensive plan for recovering this species in the wild (CBSG 1993). During the workshop, it became clear the current mortality level of juvenile iguanas in the wild was too high to permit survival of the population. This led to recommendations for a captive headstarting program at the Hope Zoo, which has resulted in the release of 138 iguanas back into the Hellshire Hills from 1996 through 2010.<br/></p><p>The JIRCG is now known as the Jamaican Iguana Recovery Group (JIRG) and includes international collaborators. In addition to captive headstarting and release, the group continues to survey the wider Hellshire Hills, monitors individuals in the core area centered around the known nesting sites, and is detailing a complete natural history of the species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2004; Wilson and van Veen 2005, 2008). Repatriated animals have demonstrated high survivorship and are now integrated into the breeding population. Complementary predator control in the core area has resulted in improved recruitment attributable to enhanced survival among younger age classes. The group also focuses on education, international awareness, and habitat protection and improvement.<br/></p><p>In 1994, an <em>ex situ</em> captive population was initiated with the importation of 12 iguanas to three U.S. institutions (Indianapolis Zoo, Fort Worth Zoo, and Gladys Porter Zoo). In 1996, this group was supplemented by a second importation of 12 iguanas to the San Diego Zoo, Central Florida Zoo, and Sedgwick County Zoo. After successful breeding in the U.S., the program has expanded to Fresno, Miami, and St. Louis zoos. The primary purpose of the U.S. captive population is to promote education, awareness, and provide support for the ongoing recovery effort of the wild population. Additionally, the captive colony is managed for long-term maintenance of genetic diversity in the event of catastrophic loss in the wild population (Grant 2010).<br/></p><p>As a further safeguard against extinction, captive-reared juvenile iguanas may also be used to establish satellite populations on the Goat Islands, provided the islands can be rendered free of predators and goats. A priority goal, highlighted in the 2006 Jamaican Iguana Species Recovery Plan, outlines establishing a dry forest biodiversity reserve on these offshore islets and is arguably the single most critical conservation activity ensuring the long-term recovery of the Jamaican Iguana. <br/></p><p>The species is listed on CITES Appendix I.<br/>         </p><p></p><p></p>",

However, extensive surveying has shown that iguanas are only found near the central core area that is protected from mongoose (&lt;10 km\u00b2). Despite the proximity to Jamaica\u2019s densely populated capital Kingston, the Hellshire Hills persist as a wilderness area because of its ruggedness and lack of surface water, making the area unsuitable for agriculture and large-scale settlement.

A preliminary survey in 1990 revealed a small surviving population of fewer than 100 animals living in the least disturbed central and western sections of the Hellshire Hills. Two active nesting sites were also found though juvenile recruitment appeared to be minimal.

      "threats": "The most significant pressure on the remaining population in areas of intact forest are alien invasive predators, including mongooses, cats, stray dogs, and possibly feral pigs. Mongooses are very common throughout the Hellshire Hills and field observations indicate they prey on both young iguanas and iguana eggs. Cats occur throughout the area and are also known predators of juvenile iguanas. The dogs used to hunt feral pigs are of particular concern, as they are able to kill adult iguanas (Woodley 1980). Although feral pigs have not been observed disturbing iguana nests in the Hellshire Hills, evidence from Mona Island suggests they are potentially important egg predators (Wiewandt 1977).<br/><br/>Another significant problem is illegal tree cutting in the forest for use in charcoal production, a local industry that provides income to an estimated 10,000 Jamaicans. Approximately one-third of the Hellshire Hills is badly degraded as a result of this enterprise. Development projects proposing large-scale limestone mining, human settlements, and tourism also threaten the eastern half of the Hellshire Hills. Although a few localized limestone quarries might have only limited impact on the iguanas and their habitat, the new roads that would be constructed to facilitate the mining process would undoubtedly allow charcoal burners, pig hunters, and other forest users to migrate further into the forest.<br/><br/>The Jamaican Iguana is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), however, this iguana has not been utilized by humans since well before the late 1800s."

For depleted Leatherback populations to recover, the most prevalent and impactful threats must be reduced wherever they occur, whether on nesting beaches or in feeding, migratory, or other habitats (Bellagio Report 2007; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013); a holistic approach that addresses threats at all life history stages needs to be implemented (Dutton and Squires 2011).&#160;</p>",

      "population_trend": "Decreasing", 
      "rationale": "<p><em>Rationale</em></p>  <p>The Southwest Indian Leatherback subpopulation nests principally along the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal), with some nesting in Mozambique. Marine habitats extend around the Cape of Good Hope in both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material). Despite some areas of overlap in distribution with the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation, the Southwest Atlantic subpopulation is genetically distinct from this and all other Leatherback subpopulations (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013).<em><br/><br/></em>The Leatherback nesting population in South Africa has been monitored consistently for 50 years, and accounts for &gt;90% of the total abundance of the subpopulation (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material) (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013). Based on analysis of long-term time series datasets of abundance\u2014i.e. annual counts of nesting females and nests\u2014this Leatherback subpopulation has declined slightly (-5.6%) during the past three generations (Table 1 and Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Although the population decline does not meet any threatened category under Criterion A, the restricted range (area of occupancy=1,500 km<sup>2</sup>), single location (i.e. one genetic stock for the entire subpopulation), small population size (estimated 148 mature individuals), and continuing (although small) decline meet thresholds for the Vulnerable category under B2ab(v), the Endangered category under criteria C2a(i,ii) and D and the Critically Endangered category under Criterion C2a(ii). Because IUCN Red List Guidelines stipulate that the criterion that triggers the highest threatened category must be selected for the assessment, the Southwest Indian Ocean Leatherback subpopulation is considered <em>Critically&#160;</em><em>Endangered </em>(<em>C2a(ii)</em>) based on IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011).<br/><br/><em>Justification</em></p>  <p>Considering the small number of mature individuals (estimated 148 adult males and females total in this subpopulation) and the evidence of a small but continuing decline, assessment of available data under Criterion C resulted in a Critically Endangered classification (C2a(ii)).<br/><br/>Our analyses of long-term abundance trends in this Southwest Indian subpopulation agree generally with results of the long-term monitoring project in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, which have reported rapid increase in the Leatherback population during the first decade of monitoring, followed by inter-annual fluctuations in abundance, but an overall stable or slightly decreasing trend (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013) (Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This abundance trend for Leatherbacks contrasts with the increasing trend and larger abundance of Loggerheads that nest along the same coastline, but drivers of these divergent patterns are unclear at present (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em>Assessment Procedure</em></p>  <p>We assessed the status of the Southwest Indian Leatherback subpopulation by Criteria A-D; because no population viability analysis has been performed, Criterion E could not be applied.<br/><br/><u>Criterion A:</u> We compiled time series datasets of monitored nesting activities (e.g. tracks or nests) or individual nesting females from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Nel 2008, 2012; Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), and Mozambique (Lombard and Kyle 2010). For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (NRC 2010). The South Africa time series began in 1965, whereas the Mozambique time series began in 1994; the nesting abundance in South Africa is &gt;90% of the total subpopulation abundance (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). We presented and analysed all abundance data in numbers of nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, as this metric was the most commonly available (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We calculated annual and overall population trends for both the South Africa and Mozambique datasets, and then calculated the average subpopulation trend by weighting rookery population trends by historical rookery abundance relative to historical subpopulation abundance. Both time series datasets were \u226510 yr, so were both included in trend estimations (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). The most recent year for available abundance data across rookeries and subpopulations was 2010.<br/><br/>To apply Criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN 2011). For A2, data from three generations ago (~100 yr) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago through the present (i.e. assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like marine turtles\u2014with generation lengths of 30 yr or more\u2014are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). Abundance data from ~100 yr ago are not available for Leatherbacks anywhere in the world. We considered extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets inappropriate&#160;because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations (~100 years, one generation estimated 30 yr; see below) ago was similar to the first observed abundance than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply Criterion A to this subpopulation, we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations (Tables 1 and 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We also applied A4 to the Southwest Indian subpopulation, using the same overall scheme as described above. Criterion A4 permits for analysis of population trend during a \u201cmoving window\u201d of time, i.e. over three generations, but where the time window must include the past, present, and future. Therefore, we made the same assumption about earliest available historical abundance being equivalent to the subpopulation abundance for generations past, and estimated future population abundance in 2020, 2030, and 2040, i.e. within one generation. This future projection assumes that the derived population trend will continue without deviation during the next generation. Implicit in this assumption is that no changes to degree of threats impacting rookeries or the subpopulation will occur during that time. This is a reasonable assumption, based on available information, because threats to Leatherbacks in this region persist (see Nel 2012 for review).<br/><br/>Based on our assessment of the multi-decade time series available for the Southwest Indian subpopulation, the slight decline (-5.6%) over the past three generations did not meet thresholds of any threatened criteria under Criterion A2 (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Likewise, future projections of abundance of this subpopulation show abundance declining slightly (up to -8.3%) by the year 2040\u2014i.e., within the next generation (see below)\u2014which does not meet thresholds for threat categories under Criterion A4 (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B:</u> We defined extent of occurrence (EOO) as the total area included within the geo-referenced boundaries of the Southwest Indian Leatherback subpopulation (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), which we calculated to be &gt;19 million km<sup>2</sup>. We defined area of occupancy (AOO) as the linear distribution of nesting sites within the EOO, which we estimated based on the linear extent of nesting sites in the State of the World\u2019s Sea Turtles\u2014SWOT database (<a href=\"http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot\">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>) to be approximately 750 km. We then multiplied this linear extent by 2 km to account for the IUCN Guidelines for calculating linear AOOs using minimum grid cell size of 2 km x 2 km. The AOO for this subpopulation was thus estimated to be 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>. There is a single \u201clocation\u201d (defined as biological rookeries, i.e. genetic stocks; Dutton <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013) within the EOO for this subpopulation. Taking into account the continuing and projected negative population trend over three generations (-5.6% through 2010, -8.3% through 2040; Tables 1 and 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material), this subpopulation meets thresholds for <em>Vulnerable under Criterion B2, subcriteria a (1 location) and b (v; continuing decline in number of mature individuals)</em>.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C:</u> To apply Criterion C, we first calculated the number of mature individuals in the subpopulation, i.e. the total number of adult females and males. First, we divided the current average annual number of nests (n=259, Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material) by the estimated clutch frequency (i.e. average number of clutches per female; n=7; Nel 2008, Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013) to obtain an average annual number of nesting females. Next, we multiplied this value by the average re-migration interval (i.e. years between consecutive nesting seasons; n=3 yr; Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013) to obtain a total number of adult females that included nesting as well as non-nesting turtles. Finally, to account for adult males, we assumed that the sex ratio of hatchlings produced on nesting beaches in the Southwest Indian was similar to sex ratios elsewhere (i.e. East Pacific; approximately 75% female, or 3:1 female:male ratio), and that this reflected the natural adult sex ratio. This calculation provided an estimated mature adult population of 148 mature individuals, which met thresholds for threatened categories under Criterion C. Taking into account the continuing and projected negative population trend (-5.6% through 2010, -8.3% through 2040; Tables 1 and 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material), this subpopulation meets thresholds for<em> Critically&#160;</em><em>Endangered</em> <em>under</em> <em>Criterion C2, subcriterion a(ii) (i.e. 90-100% of individuals in one location)</em>.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D:</u> The Southwest Indian subpoplation has &lt;250 mature individuals (estimated 148), a single location (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013), and a continuing and projected population decline. Considered together, this subpopulation meets thresholds for <em>Endangered under Criterion D</em>.<br/><br/><em>Estimating Generation Length:</em></p><p>Leatherback age at maturity is uncertain, and estimates range widely (see Jones <em>et al</em>.  2011 for review). Reported estimates fall between 9-15 yr, based on  skeletochronology (Zug and Parham 1996), and inferences from  mark-recapture studies (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore,  updated skeletochronological analyses estimated Leatherback age at  maturity to be between 26-32 yr (mean 29 yr) (Avens <em>et al</em>.  2009). Extrapolations of captive growth curves under controlled thermal  and trophic conditions suggested that size at maturity could be reached  in 7-16 yr (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011). Thus, a high degree of variance  and uncertainty remains about Leatherback age at maturity in the wild.  Likewise, Leatherback lifespan is unknown. Long-term monitoring studies  of Leatherback nesting populations have tracked individual adult females  over multiple decades (e.g. Santidri\u00e1n Tomillo&#160;<em>et al</em>.  unpublished data, Nel and Hughes unpublished data), but precise  estimates of reproductive lifespan and longevity for Leatherbacks are  currently unavailable.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define  generation length to be the average age of parents in a population;  older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature  individual (IUCN 2011). Thus, for the purposes of this assessment, we  estimated generation length to be 30 yr, or equal to the age at maturity  (estimated to be 20 yr on average), plus a conservative estimate of  reproductive half-life of 10 yr, as assumed by Nel <em>et al</em>. (2013).<br/><br/><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></p>  <p>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (NRC 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (NRC 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Leatherbacks, including age at maturity (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review), generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, re-migration intervals, etc.). These values can vary among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends (SWOT Scientific Advisory Board 2011). For example, monitoring effort on Matura beach, Trinidad, has changed multiple times since the early 1990s, which necessitated a modelling exercise to estimate a complete time series for years with reliable monitoring levels (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, there was a general lack of measures of variance around annual counts provided for the assessment, which could be erroneously interpreted as equally high confidence in all estimates. Measures of variance around annual counts would provide information about relative levels of monitoring effort within and among rookeries, and thus reliability of resulting estimates. For all of these reasons, results of this assessment of global population decline should be considered with caution.

(2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Leatherbacks globally, followed by human consumption of Leatherback eggs, meat, or other products and coastal development. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored in three subpopulations and climate change was only scored in two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess the impacts of these threats on Leatherbacks\u2014and other marine turtle species\u2014should be a high priority for future research monitoring efforts. </p>  <p>For the Southwest Indian subpopulation, fisheries bycatch has been considered to be the biggest threat (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011, Nel 2012). Rigorous estimates of Leatherback bycatch in fishing gear throughout the region are necessary to adequately quantify the relative impacts on this subpopulation. Threats to nesting females and their eggs and hatchlings have been addressed by the ongoing monitoring and conservation efforts in South Africa, while harvest of eggs and of Leatherbacks at-sea and on nesting beaches persists in Mozambique (Nel 2012).</p>"

An East African Community Rhino Management Group meeting which had a focus on African rhino genetics (and was also attended by some IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group and Conservation Specialist Group members) recommended that due to this co-occurrence, these three ESU's in East Africa should constitute and be managed as a single Eastern Black Rhino Management Unit Cluster (equivalent to&#160;<em>Diceros bicornis michaeli</em>).<br/><br/>Based on very small sample sizes, Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) results suggested that perhaps the original historical Black Rhino&#160;that used to occur in Zambia but which had been wiped out by poaching by 1995 might be better classified as&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli</em>&#160;than&#160;<em>D. b.minor</em>. However, on account of the small sample sizes, and given that the species was reintroduced with<em>&#160;D. b. minor&#160;</em>founders, and that historically Zambia had been&#160; considered&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range; reviewers recommended that historical pre-1995 Zambian animals should continue to be allocated to&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;for this Red List revision (as has historically been the case). With further data this may change in future. As there were still significant numbers of Black Rhinos in Zambia in the early 1970s how these animals are allocated influences the<em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&#160;</em><em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;subspecies Red List assessment which would change to Endangered under criteria A2 and A4.

It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary material file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff.

Using consecutive annual accounts of incubating adults and a population model the population has been estimated at c. 1,700 breeding pairs, giving a total global population of 7,100 individuals (ACAP 2010). Recent counts suggest that the population on Gough has decreased by 28% over 46 years, and at 3% annually between 2000 and 2011 (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2014), and by nearly 50% between 2001-2016 (0-8% decline per year; RSPB and UCT <em>unpubl. data</em>) in line with population modelling predictions of annual decline rates of 2.9-5.3% (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2001, Wanless <em>et al</em>. 2009), equivalent to declines of &gt;96% in three generations.

Immature birds begin returning to their breeding colony at 3-7 years after fledging. The vast majority of <em>D. dabbenena </em>recruit in their natal colony, at a mean age of 10 years (range 4-20 years) (ACAP 2009). The oldest recorded bird was at least 38 years old (Ryan 2009). It catches prey by surface-seizing, and the prevalence of a bioluminescent group of cephalopods in one dietary study suggests that <em>D. dabbenena </em>often feed at night (ACAP 2009).

Cooper <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It has been estimated that c. 500 individuals of this species are killed every year by longliners (Goren and Ryan 2010). Satellite tracking of breeding birds indicates considerable overlap between bird distribution and areas of longline fishing (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2005). A study of great albatross bycatch from Uruguayan and Japanese longline fisheries in the south-west Atlantic off Uruguay found most Tristan Albatross bycatch occurred between September and November in pelagic waters where many other fleets operate (Jim\u00e9nez <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  On-land threats include predation by introduced species. On Inaccessible Island, population decline was probably due to predation by rats, feral pigs (now absent) and humans (Fraser <em>et al</em>. 1988, Ryan <em>et al</em>. 1990). The failure to recover is unclear, but may be because young birds become entangled in thick vegetation (Ryan <em>et al</em>. 1990, P. G. Ryan <em>in litt</em>. 1999), or there is a high mortality in long-line fisheries. On Tristan, its extirpation was probably the result of human exploitation (Hagen 1952), although predation by rats (and possibly mice) may have been a factor (Fraser <em>et al</em>. 1988). At present, the greatest risk is posed by house mice <em>Mus musculus</em>, which causes very low breeding success on Gough and alone is sufficient to drive a population decline of over 50% over three generations (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cuthbert and Hilton 2004, Wanless <em>et al</em>. 2007, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mouse attacks on chicks peaked in May-June at the start of the austral winter and all predation took place at night, normally 1-2 mice were recorded attacking the chick, with death occurring 3.9 \u00b11.2 days after the first attack (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2015). An additional threat on Gough is peat slips caused by storms burying and killing nestlings and adults, although this is probably a very rare event (Ryan 1993).<p></p><p></p>"

After media exposure of the crisis there was an attempt to clamp down on illegal trade in this species (S.

There is ongoing research on Sakhalin to find out if difference in migration strategies (e. g. key stopover and wintering sites) is responsible for contrasting sustainability of different populations.

      "geographic_range": "This species once bred across the northern Palaearctic from <strong>Finland</strong>, <strong>Belarus</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> in the west, through <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, <strong>China</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong>, to far eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Korea</strong> and northern <strong>Japan</strong>. However, after a precipitous decline it is now thought to have potentially completely disappeared from Finland, Belarus, Ukraine and large parts of Russia (Kamp <em>et al. </em>2015). In the autumn, birds stop-over in large numbers to moult in the Yangtze Valley, China, before continuing on to their winter quarters. It winters in a relatively small region in South and South-East Asia, which includes eastern <strong>Nepal</strong>, north-eastern <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, southern China, <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong> and <strong>Thailand</strong> (Byers <em>et al.</em> 1995). It was formerly one of the most abundant breeding passerines across vast swathes of Siberia, but although there have been no systematic surveys, a severe decline has been noted in most breeding areas and it has completely disappeared from parts of its former breeding range since the early 1990s (Kamp <em>et al. </em>2015). No birds have been recorded breeding in Finland since 2009, and its range has contracted northwards by 300 km in Kazakhstan since the late 1990s, although it does persist in some areas of Kazakhstan, such as along the Irtysh river near  Irtyshsk (R. Ay\u00e9 <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is estimated to have declined by 95-99% in European Russia between 2000 and 2012 (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;<br/>Declines have been reported in the Moscow, Novgorod, Kostroma, Ulyanovsk and Baikal regions (A. Mischenko <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012), whilst very rapid declines in the Tyumen region were reported in 2011 (J. Kamp <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012), suggesting a massive decline in the core range (M. Flade<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt.</span> 2007).&#160;Surveys in 2012 and 2013 suggest that the species has nearly or  completely disappeared from Tyumen province in Western Siberia, which  appears consistent with an impression of a steep decline across  Western Siberia (J. Kamp <em>et al</em>. <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In contrast, recent  surveys within and outside protected areas in Amur and Chabarovsk  regions, suggest that the species is faring better in the east of its  breeding range, with an estimate of 100-150 breeding pairs in Muraviovka  Park (c.6,500 ha) in 2013, although anecdotal evidence indicates a  decline in these areas since the 1990s (J. Kamp <em>et al</em>. <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Severe declines have also been noted in Hokkaido, Japan and Mongolia (Tamada <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Chan and&#160;O. Goroshko <em>in litt. </em>2003, Tamada 2006, M. Gilbert, A. Mischenko and J. Kamp <em>in litt. </em>2007). Kamp <em>et al. </em>(2015) have estimated that between 1980 and 2013 the population may have declined by 84.3-94.7%, with an eastwards range retraction of 5,000 km.<br/><br/>It no longer occurs in \"swarms\" at migration watch-points such as Beidaihe, China, and although a range-wide survey is required, numbers at wintering sites throughout its range have also shown rapid declines over the last twenty years (S. Chan, M. Williams,&#160;J. W. Duckworth and<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&#160;</span>N. Moores <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2003, T. Evans, M. Gilbert, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span>M. Williams and&#160;S. Chan <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Based on evidence from wintering grounds in Cambodia the species is  said to be clearly declining (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Historically, it was noted to be common on the central plain, but is now considered scarce away from the Tonle Sap area, and surveys of birds used in \"merit releases\" at Phnom Penh riverfront suggest a steep decline in this species since the mid-1990s in the Mekong-Bassac floodplain, where most merit-bird trappers operate (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Furthermore, there has been a lack of records from south-eastern Cambodia since the late 1990s, suggesting that it is very rare and perhaps close to extirpation in that region (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In Nepal, declines in the population and number of localities occupied have been noted since 1990 (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2013, Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). It also appears to have declined at the Hail Haor wetland in north-eastern Bangladesh since the mid-1980s (P. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2013, 2017). It should be noted that interpretation of the species's status in its non-breeding range based on the usually fragmentary information available is hindered by the erratic appearance of very large flocks (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013).<br/><p></p>",

It winters in large flocks in cultivated areas, rice fields and grasslands, preferring scrubby dry-water rice fields for foraging and reedbeds for roosting (T. Gray <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The breeding season is normally from the second half of June to the beginning of July. The nest is built by the female alone and is placed either on the ground in a depression under tussocks or roots or slightly above ground in well covered vegetation. It is constructed of dry grass and stalks lined with soft grass, rootlets and sometimes hair. Clutch size can vary between three and seven but most commonly four to five. During the breeding season it feeds mainly on invertebrates and at other times it will feed on seeds and other plant material. The species is migratory, wintering from central and eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India east to south-east China (Guangdong) and Taiwan (Province of China), south to the north Malay Peninsula and south-east Asia&#160;(Copete and Sharpe 2016).  <p></p>", 
      "threats": "Since many populations on pristine breeding grounds have dropped rapidly, the decline is likely to be driven by excessive trapping at migration and, in particular, wintering sites (Kamp <em>et al. </em>2015, S. Chan <em>in litt.</em> 2003, 2007,&#160;P. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2003,<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> </span>M. Williams <em>in litt. </em>2007). Roosting flocks in reedbeds are disturbed and then caught in mist-nets, they are cooked and sold as \"sparrows\" or \"rice-birds\"; this practice was formerly restricted to a small area of southern China, but has now become more widespread and popular owing to increasing affluence, and hunters now have to travel widely to find sufficient birds (M. Lau <em>in litt. </em>2007, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> </span>M. Williams <em>in litt. </em>2007, S. Chan <em>in litt.</em> 2007). From 1992 onwards, an estimated several thousand individuals of this species were caught for the  annual food festival in Sanshui City, southern China (Gao Yuren 1996). This practice was banned in 1997, but a black market in birds still persists  and a huge number of birds are still sold annually (see Kamp <em>et al. </em>2015),  including around 10,000 birds sold daily in a single market in Sanshui  (Chan 2004). In 2008, one shipment of 4,300 individuals of this species was reportedly confiscated in Zhejiang province en route to Guangdong province, and the species is said to remain a famous delicacy in southern China (<em>per</em> M. Zhang <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Likewise, the species is considered a delicacy in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and is trapped to be sold to restaurants in Nepal (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In China, thousands of males are also stuffed and sold as mascots, since their presence in the home is thought to confer happiness (A. Mischenko <em>in litt. </em>2012)<strong></strong>. At least locally, for example in Cambodia, birds are trapped for \"merit release\" in temples<strong> </strong>(Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2012, J. C. Eames <em>in litt. </em>2007, F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). <br/><br/>Agricultural intensification, the shift to irrigated rice production and consequent loss of winter stubble has reduced the quality and quantity of wintering habitat, and the loss of reedbeds has reduced the number of available roost sites (T. Evans <em>in litt. </em>2007,&#160;J. Tordoff <em>in litt. </em>2007, J. C. Eames <em>in litt. </em>2007). Declines caused by pressures on the wintering grounds are compounded by a reduction in habitat quality on the breeding grounds in parts of its range, particularly drying of meadows caused by changes in the flow pattern of rivers, a result of dam construction upstream (O. Goroshko <em>in litt. </em>2003, J. Kamp <em>in litt. </em>2007). Declines in Nepal have also been partly attributed to changes in agricultural practices since the 1980s, notably sharp increases in pesticide use (Inskipp and Baral 2011).<br/><p></p>"

      "threats": "<em>Empetrichthys latos pahrump</em> is extinct due to groundwater pumping; <em>E. l. concavus</em> is extinct due to groundwater pumping and springhead filling (Minckley <em>et al</em>. 1991), and <em>E. l. latos</em> was extirpated in its native range when its spring dried up as a result of excessive groundwater pumping for irrigation. The Corn Creek population was extirpated as a result of an illegal introduction of non-native crayfish, with non-native goldfish possibly also contributing to the decline (USFWS 2004). Illegal introductions of nonnative aquatic species currently pose the most significant threat to the existence of this species.<br/><br/>Long-term declines in spring flows due to groundwater pumping from areas surrounding existing poolfish habitat remain a threat to all the populations. Threats to water sources necessary for poolfish habitat have been minimized to the extent possible by the managing Federal and State agencies (USFWS 2004). However, it is likely that demands on the groundwater system to accommodate extensive human population growth and development in southern Nevada could threaten the future existence of the poolfish. <br/><br/>Recent residential development in and around the native habitat at Manse Ranch continues to modify the native habitat, and future residential and commercial development in the Pahrump Valley may limit the available water resources and preclude the opportunity to re-establish a poolfish population in this location (USFWS 2004).<br/><br/>Poolfish populations at Corn Creek and Shoshone Ponds Natural Area are vulnerable to vandalism (USFWS 2004).<br/><br/>Jelks <em>et al</em>.

Cattle has been grazed in the area for the past 100 years (B. Whiting pers. comm. to J. Morey undated).

Climate change, including increasing temperature, alterations to hydrological regimes, severe weather events, loss of suitable rainforest habitat and increased potential for bushfires (Chiew and McMahon 2002, Howden 2003, Hughes 2003, Pittock 2003, Hennessy 2006, Westoby and Burgman 2006, IPCC 2007); 3.

Other introduced exotic species (cats, foxes, pigs, goats) that have generally been found to impact on crayfish (Green and Osbourne 1981, Horwitz 1990, Merrick 1995, Eyre<em> et al.</em> 1997, ACT Government 2007, O'Brien 2007) also occur in this species' range (DEH 2004a,c,d,e) and given this species highly restricted distribution, could have serious impacts by contributing to declines in its distribution and/or abundance (J. Coughran and J.M. Furse pers. comm. 2009).   Due to the narrow thermal tolerance of this species, and its restricted range (restricted to cool, headwater streams in forested catchments), global temperature increase has resulted in range contraction. This species is further compromised by the presence of exotic species (feral pigs, foxes, goats, Cane Toads and cats) which are known to predate on crayfish and degrade riparian habitat; while the precise effects of these threats on this species are not yet well understood, they are believed to be significantly impacting the long term viability of the population (J.

As a result, we assess population decline estimates since around 1970 for the purpose of validation of criterion A. The generation length can also be estimated calculating the mean between the age of the first reproduction and the longevity which in this case would be 19 years, the span of three generations would be then 57 years.

In general, since the mid-1800s, mussel habitat has been reduced in many Texas waters by overgrazing, reduction in vegetative cover and soils, increasing numbers of scouring floods, and general increases in the amount of precipitation (Howells 2010)."

The rapid rate of decline is thought to have now slowed, as the majority of the most vulnerable sub-populations have been extirpated. <em>G. eldoni</em>&#160;is very slow growing and is relatively long lived compared to other non-migratory galaxiids, living up to 15 years of age.

However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Three of the four historical accounts, and one of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Widenose Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) and Halavi Guitarfish (<em>G.</em>&#160;<em>halavi</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of an 81% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country\u2019s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 94-95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Widenose Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of an 86% population reduction over the last three generations of the Widenose Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (<em>G. typus</em>) and Clubnose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Landings declined by 86% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Widenose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Widenose Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",

Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Widenose Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010),&#160;and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Widenose Guitarfish is landed throughout its range and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka&#160;(Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017).

There are plans to extend the road through the heart of the Chatham Bay site, which would destroy much of the rock and litter cover that represents critical habitat for this gecko. Land clearance along the slope for housing and agriculture is already underway in the northeast of the bay (Bentz <em>et al.</em> 2011), and the construction and upslope expansion of tourist facilities threatens to place additional pressure on this area. <em></em>The introduction of exotic mammals, particularly feral goats which destroy understorey vegetation and cats which are known to prey on small reptiles, also represents a severe threat to this species (Bentz <em>et al.</em> 2011). The import of building materials to the area from South America also has the potential to introduce other exotic animals, such as snakes, which may prey on the lizards. An earlier Red List assessment of this species (Powell and Henderson 2011) predicted that additional pressure on this rare and attractive gecko from commercial exploitation could have a dramatic effect on the population, and subsequently this species has been offered for sale in Europe and imported into the United States (Noseworthy 2017, Shepherd <em>et al.</em> 2019). At least two thirds of animals advertised for sale were male (with a further 17% of \"unknown sex\") (Shepherd <em>et al. </em>2019). If this reflects a genuine collection bias rather than small sample size, it could be of significant conservation concern if males are selectively removed from the population (Shepherd<em> et al.</em> 2019), in addition to the direct impacts of offtake (which is likely to be higher than reported by Shepherd<em> et al. </em>2019 as these represent only animals that both survived collection and transportation and were offered for sale online - J. Daltry pers. comm. 2019). The methods used to collect animals cause damage to the habitat by removing or disturbing shelter sites, increasing the exposure of surviving animals to desiccation or predation (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2019). Harvesting effort appears to have focused on localities reported by Bentz <em>et al.</em> (2011), and resurveys of these sites in 2018 found that gecko densities had fallen by 80% since 2010 (J.

Approximately 30% of Cross River Gorillas occur outside of protected areas and many important habitat corridors between subpopulations exist as ungazetted land. The recent creation of new protected areas in Cameroon combined with existing protected areas in Nigeria, provides the legal framework for habitat protection and the control of hunting.

A series of recommendations have been outlined, which can be broadly encapsulated as:<br/><ol><li>An increase in effective law enforcement throughout the region, not only in protected areas, but also in logging concessions and unprotected forests. Law enforcement needs to be supported by updated regulations and sanctions.</li><li>Effective, coordinated land-use planning to avoid the clearing of intact Gorilla habitat to establish industrial plantations, for oil palm in particular (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). Industrial extraction of other natural resources, namely timber and minerals, should be included in a holistic, spatially-explicit approach. Such planning needs to be done at both national and regional levels. Several of the most important areas for Gorilla conservation are transboundary, and thus fall within the remit of national agencies from two or three countries.</li><li>Awareness raising among all sectors that deal with land and the protection of natural resources: law enforcement and judiciary; protected area authorities; mining, logging and agricultural industries; local communities and tour operators. This outreach effort should include specific information on minimising human impacts, such as preventing transmission of human diseases to great apes. Recommendations for logging companies regarding management practices that are compatible with great ape conservation (Morgan and Sanz 2007, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013) can be downloaded here: <a href=\"http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_logging\">http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_logging</a></li><li>Further research into ways of mitigating the spread and virulence of <em>Ebolavirus</em>, such as administering vaccines that are non-detrimental to the target species (great apes) or other species that may come into contact with the vaccine, and that protect a sufficiently large and geographically appropriate proportion of the great ape population to form barriers against its spread.

A standardised tool for law enforcement monitoring (SMART: <a href=\"http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org\">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>) is already in use at many sites; standard methods for surveying and monitoring great ape populations that facilitate more accurate and precise monitoring of changes in abundance have been in use for about a decade (K\u00fchl <em>et al</em>. 2008 <a href=\"http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys\">http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys</a>); and non-invasive diagnosis of a range of pathogens is now possible, for example, detection of <em>Ebolavirus</em> in faeces (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li>Specifically for Cross River Gorillas, the key conservation need for their long-term survival is allowing the population to expand. Since significant areas of unoccupied Gorilla habitat remain across the landscape, population growth is feasible if levels of hunting and other human activities can be reduced. Maintenance (or re-establishment) of habitat connectivity between areas currently occupied by Gorillas is essential for future population expansion.</li></ol>Maintaining well-protected areas of forest will be key to maintaining Gorilla populations in the long term, and this can only be done through the conservation strategies detailed in the action plans.

Genetic evidence suggests that these subpopulations have had reproductive contact in the recent past (Bergl and Vigilant 2007); however, field surveys paired with remote sensing analysis reveal that forest corridors connecting subpopulations may no longer be functional as routes for dispersal (Imong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas are found in almost all protected areas and many of the logging concessions in their range; they can persist at high densities in well-managed logging concessions (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160; Strindberg <em>et al</em>.

Only a very small number of Western Gorillas are the <em>G. g. diehli</em> subspecies, therefore this rationale focuses on the <em>G. g. gorilla</em> subspecies. The country of Gabon lost over half its Gorilla population between 1983 and 2000 (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003).

The results reveal an 19.4% decline between 2005 and 2013, corresponding to an annual loss of ~2.7% (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). These population decreases were driven by poaching and disease (<em>Ebolavirus</em>) outbreaks.<br/><br/>Despite their abundance and wide geographic range, Western Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A: a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (one generation is ~22 years). This listing is based on ongoing population losses due to illegal hunting, disease and habitat loss: poaching is intensifying with the expansion of access routes into forests and Zaire <em>Ebolavirus</em> remains a highly significant threat. At a conservative rate of reduction (2.7% per year rather than 4%, calculated from Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003), the reduction in the Western Gorilla population is predicted to exceed 80% over three generations (i.e., 66 years, 2005\u20132071). Illegal hunting has not ceased despite intense anti-poaching efforts, and the threat of <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been removed.

The highly-seasonal nature of the Cross River Gorillas\u2019 habitat (more markedly seasonal than that of other Gorilla populations) likely contributes to grouping and ranging patterns. Their diet reflects this seasonality, with terrestrial herbs and bark eaten as staples throughout the year, and fruit consumed during periods of seasonal abundance (McFarland 2007, De Vere <em>et al</em>. 2011, Etiendem and Tagg 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas occur in both swamp and <em>terra firma</em> lowland forests throughout Western Equatorial Africa. They are especially common where ground vegetation is dominated by monocotyledonous plants such as <em>Haumania liebrechtsiana</em> and <em>Megaphrynium macrostachyum</em> (Rainey <em>et al</em>. 2009). Staple and fallback foods are pith of <em>Aframomum</em> spp. and leaves and shoots of the Marantaceae family, whereas fruit consumption varies greatly between seasons (Rogers <em>et al</em>. 2004). Some populations spend hours feeding on aquatic herbs in ba\u00efs and swamps. Social ants and termites are the only animal matter deliberately ingested. Group size averages 10, but is occasionally over 20 individuals, and annual home ranges are usually 10\u201325 km\u00b2 (Williamson and Butynski 2013).<br/><br/>Life History (as summarised in Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013): Male Western Gorillas take 18 years to reach full maturity, and females take <em>ca</em>10 years. Length of the reproductive cycle is unknown. There is no birth season. Mean length of gestation is 256 days in captive Gorillas. Infant mortality up to three years of age is 22\u201365%. Infants suckle for 4\u20135 years, causing lactational amenorrhea in the mother. Interbirth intervals are 4\u20136 years. Western Gorillas appear to reproduce more slowly than Eastern Gorillas (<em>G. beringei</em>). Maximum life span is unknown, but likely to be <em>ca</em> 40 years. Generation time is estimated to be 22 years (see Appendix I in the supplementary material).", 
      "threats": "The two subspecies of Western Gorilla face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions.<br/><br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u></strong> - Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting for bushmeat is the primary driver of Western Gorilla decline. Current offtake levels are unsustainable \u2013 even legally-protected areas suffer high levels of poaching. The remaining population of Cross River Gorillas is small and fragmented, which puts each subpopulation at particular risk from poaching. While Gorillas do not generally appear to be targeted by hunters, it is estimated that opportunistic hunting removes at least 1\u20133 Cross River Gorillas from the population each year. Additionally, snares targeting other species may trap Gorillas, causing injury or death. Until the mid-1990s, much of the Western Lowland Gorilla\u2019s range included vast, roadless blocks of forest that were extremely difficult to access, where human population densities were very low and Gorilla densities high. In the last quarter century, however, almost all unprotected terra firma forest in this region has been allocated as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that much of the once-remote, inaccessible forest is now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007), which gives easy access to both hunters entering the forest and traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat (and ivory) out of the forest to distant destinations \u2013 often towns and cities where meat fetches high prices. Throughout Central Africa, mining permits for prospecting or resource extraction are being issued over an increasingly large surface area. As well as direct removal of Gorilla habitat, depending on the type of extraction, mining leads to very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are used for poaching (e.g., Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014). The region\u2019s governance is typically poor (Transparency International 2016); the weak law enforcement and corruption that enable poaching are evident in ivory trafficking (Bennett 2014), but also widespread elsewhere (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2013). In addition, huge road projects that will substantially fragment Gorilla habitat are currently underway (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). The ease and speed of transport is now orders of magnitude higher than before the creation of such access roads, and hunting pressures are much higher. Across their range, Gorilla densities are lowest near roads, except where forest guards operate control points or roadblocks (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, human populations in these once remote areas have grown, as people migrate to the employment opportunities offered by logging companies (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2000, Poulsen <em>et al</em>. 2009).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - The second major driver of Western Lowland Gorilla decline is infectious disease, specifically Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day show that there were a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003; Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2013). Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated that three quarters of Western Lowland Gorillas in six protected areas affected by <em>Ebolavirus</em> were lost between 1995 and 2000. Typical mortality rate during the worst disease outbreaks was 95% (Bermejo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Caillaud <em>et al</em>. 2006). In protected areas, populations hit by disease began to recover within a decade (e.g., Genton <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, total recovery would take 75\u2013131 years in the absence of poaching, which is an unlikely scenario (Ryan and Walsh 2011). Ebola virus has already been detected to the east of the Mambili River, a major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although rivers and forest fragmentation seem to present a partial barrier to the spread of Ebola, large numbers of Gorillas could be wiped out in a short space of time, as transmission between individuals is rapid and large areas can be affected by a single outbreak (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009). The small size of the Cross River population means it is also highly vulnerable to infectious disease. <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been reported in the Cross River Gorillas, but their close proximity to dense human populations and livestock heightens the risks of disease transmission (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li><strong><u>Habitat degradation and destruction</u></strong> - Habitat loss is emerging as a major threat to Western Gorillas. As oil-palm plantations in Asia reach capacity, Africa is becoming the new frontier for this crop, offering excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperatures (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, such areas coincide with good Gorilla habitat: 73.8% of the Western Lowland Gorilla\u2019s range is considered suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014). The recent expansion of industrial-scale mineral extraction and the creation of open-pit mines are of great concern (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lanjouw 2014), and also lead to the establishment of development corridors, which can be several kilometres wide and add to areas of \u201clost forest\u201d (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is a disconnect between the various bodies responsible for land-use planning in the realms of conservation, mining and agriculture in all Western Gorilla range states except Gabon. Consequently, there is increasing competition for land between long-term conservation needs and immediate financial gain as governments explore the potential of clearing natural habitat in favour of economic development. Without careful and immediate land-use planning that involves cooperation between the government bodies responsible for protected areas and wildlife on one hand, and economic and agricultural development on the other, large areas of Western Lowland Gorilla habitat could be cleared within a few decades. The lack of effective protected area management throughout much of the Cross River Gorilla\u2019s range combined with the lack of protected status for much of the Gorillas\u2019 habitat in Cameroon, threatens the future availability of habitat suitable for the population. Conversion of forest for agriculture and grazing is occurring rapidly in many parts of the Gorillas\u2019 range and the largest protected areas in which Cross River Gorillas occur contain enclaves of human settlements whose farmlands have spread beyond their legal boundaries. Expansion of these settlements and associated development of access routes in the form of roads and bridges inside the protected areas exacerbate subdivision of the Cross River Gorilla population. In both Cameroon and Nigeria, the construction and improvement of roads outside protected areas also threatens to increase subdivision of Gorilla populations through habitat disturbance and intensification of forest resource extraction. Increasing access will also exacerbate poaching pressure. While most habitat loss in the region is the result of small-scale agriculture, commercial logging and industrial agriculture (e.g., for oil palm) are also impending threats.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change will affect both subspecies of Western Gorilla, as it is already thought to be affecting the Central African tropical moist forests (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although the likely impacts of global climate change are not yet known, some predictions suggest a drying of this region with potentially negative consequences for forest ecology, such as changes in fruit and flower phenology, forest productivity and increased vulnerability to fire, and even forest retreat (James et al. 2013). Seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and weather extremes are likely ongoing and set to continue (Lovett 2015). Negative impacts on great apes have already been predicted (Lehmann <em>et al</em>. 2010), particularly along the coast (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2010). Climate change is the least likely factor for which effective action for great apes and for African tropical forests in general can be taken in a timely manner. Climate talks in 2015 resulted in international cooperative agreement between most of the world\u2019s nations regarding the need for action; however, the task of reversing, or even flattening current temperature trends will be extremely challenging.</li><li>For more details, see the two <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> subspecies assessments.</li></ol>"

The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, with India passing further legislation in 2008 banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac. In the same year, the Indian government ordered a crackdown on companies selling diclofenac. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. In October 2010, the government of Bangladesh banned the production of diclofenac for use in cattle, and the distribution and sale of the drug were due to be outlawed during the first half of 2011 (M.M.H. Khan<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt.</span> 2010). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> et al.</span> 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris<span lang=\"EN-US\">&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert <em>in litt. </em>2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al. </span>2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps </em>species&#160;combined (V. Prakash <em>pers. comm. per. </em>C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Wildlife Trust of India (Wildlife Trust of India (2009)<strong></strong>. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).<br/><br/>An action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2006 (Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests 2006), but has not been updated. Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia\u2019s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014). A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian Vultures is under development and is due to be considered by CMS at COP12 in October 2017.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (<strong></strong>Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008, Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2011, SAVE 2014). Promote Vulture Safe Zones, with expansion to include trans-boundary efforts as well as the opportunity for vulture-based ecotourism (SAVE 2014, 2015). Safeguard nesting areas from logging (SAVE 2014). Estimate the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vultures (SAVE 2014).</span>",

It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as \"possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world\" (Houston 1985)<strong></strong>. However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009)<strong></strong>. Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;<span lang=\"EN-US\">by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003, 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, Pakistan (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chaudhary <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013)<strong></strong>, to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,<strong></strong> Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004<strong></strong><em></em>)<strong></strong>. This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, 2004b; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements <em>et al. </em>2013])<strong></strong>. Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt</span>. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra <em>in litt. </em>2016).

      "threats": "By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2007, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a<strong></strong>, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Green <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (<strong></strong>Green <em>et al</em>. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan <em>et al. </em>2006a, Swarup <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla <em>et al. </em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong>. In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>"

Weevil census data is extremely variable annually and it is currently uncertain if the population is stable. Genetic analysis also shows that the population has less than 1% variation in the mitochondrial CO1 gene, which is indicative of very low heterozygosity and therefore poor genetic resilience, which is important in rapidly changing environments (Fountain 2009).</p>  <p><em>Hadramphus &#160;tuberculatus </em>is also at risk of extinction through predation, competition, disease and abiotic effects including habitat loss (by fire) and continued agricultural development on lands surrounding the Burkes Pass reserve in which it occurs.&#160; The taxon is therefore extremely susceptible to stochastic events. Despite extensive searches, the weevil is apparently absent in locations where it has been previously collected, and, the increasingly fragmented ecological landscape of Canterbury increases the need to translocate a sub-population of weevils to alternative sites as \u2018insurance\u2019 populations.

The deep phylogenetic isolation and evolution of <em>Hadramphus</em> in the absence of ground dwelling mammalian predators provides opportunities for molecular clock calibration studies and rates of genetic divergence within the Curculionidae.

Kuschel later erected the genus <em>Karocolens</em> to include the type species <em>K.&#160; pittospori</em> (a Molytine weevil from the Poor Knights Islands, NZ) (Kuschel 1987). &#160;In 1999 however, Craw re-instated <em>Karocolens &#160;pittospori</em> within <em>Hadramphus</em> (Craw 1999) and</span><em> Karocolens</em> is now synonymised with <em>Hadramphus.</em></p>",

      "text_habitat": "<p><em>Hadramphus tuberculatus</em> is apparently obligate on the herbaceous perennial <em>Aciphylla aurea</em> (Apiaceae), an erect spiky plant known as speargrass. Larvae are found on the thick tap roots and in soil surrounding the host plant while the adults are semi-nocturnal and feed on leaf tissues, flower stems, pollen and developing seeds. Speargrass forms part of an indigenous tussock-grassland community that includes tall tussock (<em>Chionochloa</em> spp.), short tussock (<em>Festuca</em> spp.) and herbs (<em>Celmisia</em> spp.).<br/></p>", 
      "threats": "<p>  </p><p>Threats to <em>Hadramphus tuberculatus</em> can be divided into biotic and abiotic effects. The former can be further subdivided into natural predators (bats, lizards, owls, raptors and possibly gulls) and introduced predators (rats, mice, European hedgehogs, stoats, cats and possibly birds).&#160;</p><p>The impact of indigenous predators on the weevil population is probably negligible as many of those species are in decline or in low numbers as well. However, the introduced predator guilds remain a constant threat to the small population of weevils at Burkes Pass.&#160; Like many of the Molytine weevils in New Zealand, <em>Hadramphus tuberculatus</em> displays a \u2018drop and hide\u2019 behaviour. Upon disturbance, the feeding weevils release themselves from the speargrass leaves and fall into the tiller base of the plant \u2013 an environment that is almost inaccessible to most predators on account of the long, closely arranged speargrass leaves that present a formidable barrier to most predators attacking from above (such as birds).</p>  <p>Introduced herbivores (hares, rabbits and wallabies) also have negative impact on the remaining habitat for <em>H. tuberculatus</em> at Burkes Pass. Problems with herbivores in the reserve include browsing of the host plant by hares, tunnelling beneath the plants by rabbits, the spread of competitive weeds, in particular lupins (<em>Lupinus polyphyllus</em>) by wallabies. The key effect of the herbivore threats are changes to the character of the vegetation community. However, since de-stocking of sheep, the periodic culling of wallabies and poisoning of hares, substantial improvements to the speargrass and tussock community have been observed.</p>  <p>The principle abiotic threat to the weevil is fire. The reserve is adjacent to State Highway 8, a busy tourist road through to the Mackenzie Basin and Southern Alps. Several fires have occurred in the reserve grasslands as a result of vehicle exhausts, however these were brought under control before spreading to the core weevil population. Lightning and electrical ignition from nearby transmission lines cannot be ruled out as possible fire sources. Open fires and camping stoves are not permitted in the reserve.&#160;</p>  <p>European arrival saw a very rapid, widespread and irreversible conversion of the indigenous lowland ecology into pasture and arable lands. The concomitant spread of mammalian pests probably pushed many large, flightless invertebrates into near, or complete, extinction.</p><p>The decline in numbers in recent years and the historical reduction in distribution are thought to be caused by habitat degradation, reduction in host plant numbers through fires, grazing and predation by rodents.</p>"

Since 1991, the species has been studied in the Antsalova region, where an on-going conservation programme aims to increase the known breeding population to at least 250 pairs. Activities to reach such a target include the enforcement of existing traditional laws at the local community level, and in two cases through the release of captive-reared birds rescued from siblicide (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997, Peregrine Fund 1998, Watson 1998)<strong></strong>, with the latter almost doubling the number of young fledged per nest in one study (Watson <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Manambolomaty Three Lakes Complex is a Ramsar Site in the Antsalova area and official protection was confirmed for this site in 2015. It is now called the \u201cTsimembo-Manambolomaty New Protected Area\", which protects 62,745 hectares of lakes, forests, mangroves and savanna habitats  (Peregrine Fund <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. This site and surrounding areas supported 20 territorial pairs and 50 adults in 2015, and a community-based, resource management programme (Local Management Secured System; GELOSE) means that threats to the species and its habitat both inside and outside of this area are relatively low (Razafimanjato <em>et al. </em>2017). The Mandrozo Lake New Protected Area, a new Ramsar site near Tambohorano was officially ratified in 2015 to protect 5 territorial pairs and 11 adults too. These two new protected areas are conserving more than 25% of the global breeding population of Madagascar Fish Eagles (Peregrine Fund <em>in litt. </em>2016). Persecution has been reduced at Soamalipo Lake through the establishment of a research camp by The Peregrine Fund in 1991, accompanied by community outreach activities, resulting in increased breeding productivity (Razafimanjato <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2007). <br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor the population size and distribution to detect changes (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>.

Scattered available information indicates that the species is depleted and now uncommon to rare throughout its range; survey findings consistently conclude that the species is rare and declining in India and Bangladesh (Moll 1989, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). A 50-70% decline in population is believed to have occurred in the India/Bangladesh part of the range in the past 20 years (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018). There have been a few reports of <em>Indotestdo elongata</em> individuals in Bhutan's Royal Manus National Park but abundance is low there (Wangyal&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>The best subpopulations in Thailand were estimated to have a density of one or a few animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). The sex ratio in this population was also heavily female biased at 1:2.45 (van Dijk 1998). The species is somewhat abundant within protected areas in Thailand, but is collected for consumption outside of protected areas. Habitat destruction has led to a severe reduction in population in northeastast Thailand (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In the latter part of the 20th century <em>I. elongata</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were already scarce and localised (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018). Throughout most of Cambodia and parts of southern Viet Nam, the species was relatively widespread and common. Subpopulations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and Cambodia have since been severely depleted and possibly locally extirpated.<em> Indotestudo elongata</em> is not uncommon in Myanmar, and subpopulations appear to be relatively stable (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). In Bangladesh, <em>I. elongata</em> is relatively common in good habitat, but not in areas of habitat degradation (S.C. Rahman pers. comm. 2018). The species' survival is not compatible with human land use (other than responsible tourism in national parks) and will eventually become exclusively restricted to protected areas throughout its range.

An 80% decline over the past three generations is a minimum estimate for total population reduction; remaining subpopulations may continue declining in some areas as human population grows, converts more forest, and harvests more animals.

Records are mostly from hilly areas from low altitude to about 600 m altitude. In the Himalayas it has not been recorded over 500 m (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). In Cambodia they are considered predominantly a lowland species in gentle sloping terrain. Local and seasonal movements are modest and seemingly random, tortoises apparently being confined to particular areas by features of habitat and topography (Moll 1989, Das 1991, van Dijk 1998).&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is primarily crepuscular, with activity in the early morning and late afternoon, avoiding extremely high air temperatures of up to 48\u00b0C in the forest in the middle of the day. During periods of inactivity, tortoises retreat into dense vegetation, alongside fallen debris, in buttresses of trees, in caves or burrows. The species appears to have large home ranges (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2014), signifying a need for large areas of suitable habitat to be protected. Historically the species has benefited from disturbance of evergreen forest in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam, as it prefers primarily deciduous forest types (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises consume a wide diversity of foods, feeding mainly on soft leaves and fruits, while mushrooms, carrion and carnivore scats are eaten when available. (van Dijk 1998).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises of both sexes reach maturity at about 20 cm carapace length and a weight just over 1 kg, at an estimated age of 10-14 years (van Dijk 1998). Maximum size is usually 30 cm, but exceptional animals reach 35 cm carapace length. Hatchling size is approximately 4-5 cm (S. Schoppe pers. comm. 2018). Females produce one or possibly two clutches of 1-5 eggs towards the end of the rainy season (van Dijk 1998). Generation length is estimated to be a minimum of 30 years, but is likely to be substantially longer.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>", 
      "threats": "<p>The foremost threat to <em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has been the intensive collection almost throughout its entire range for trade to East Asia, starting in 1989 the intensity of which has started to decline only since 2016. The volumes of trade may have appeared to reduced, but investigations into captive farms and legal trade reveal that trade levels&#160;for these sources may be higher than reported.<br/><br/>This intensive commercial exploitation came on top of the impacts from long-term (decades to centuries) low-intensity collection for subsistence consumption throughout its range (review in Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). In India, <em>I. elongata</em> is associated with Sal forest (<em>Shorea</em> spp); Sal flowers are collected for pharmaceutical purposes, leading to extensive opportunistic collection of tortoises. However, deliberate hunting also occurs, often with the aid of dogs (Pawar and Choudhury 20000; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2012). The species is collected both for local use and international wildlife trade. In the 1990s <em>I. elongata</em> was considered to be the most common chelonian species in the Vietnamese wildlife trade (Hendrie 1998), and large numbers have been reported in trade in Cambodia (Ihlow and Dawson 2016). Worldwide, a total of at least 918 live specimens, in 20 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73). The Elongated Tortoise is also available in the international pet trade. However, the impact of trade as pets in minimal compared to the volume of trade for food (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Animals in Nepal, northeast India and Uttar Pradesh, are extensively traded for release at religious institutions; presumably as a result of targeted collection for this purpose.<br/><br/>Habitat impacts have been extensive as deciduous forests have been logged and cleared for settlement with seasonal, dry-land (slash and burn) agriculture; available habitat for the species has shrunk by more than half in the past 50 years in Thailand, and this percentage is probably comparable in other range countries, and even higher rates of habitat loss in Cambodia. Remaining habitat including in managed protected areas is widely impacted by human-associated wildfires, which create very high mortality among juvenile tortoises, to the extent that a population may be reproducing but is barely recruiting (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). This species appears to be absent from areas of dense human population and intensive cultivation (Ihlow<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Other threats to&#160;<em>I. elongata</em> are minor and localised in comparison, with reports of decorative masks produced from the carapace available for sale in Nepal, although the species is not particularly favoured for this purpose (Mitchell and Rhodin 1996).&#160;</p>"

In some areas large shoals were reported in the past (pre-1970s) to be seen a mile or more offshore. It feeds from the sediment and biocover on the sand. This species migrates upstream in rivers and small streams to spawn with the first flood, and after spawning returns quickly to the lake. This species is a total spawner, laying all its eggs at once when the rivers are in full spate early in the rains. Both the adults and juveniles spend an extremely short time in the rivers where spawning occurs. The young fish are carried downstream after hatching. A maximum size of about 40 cm is reported from Lake Malawi for this species.", 
      "threats": "The fishery collapsed as a result of two major factors. Unlike most other migratory cyprinids in the Lake Malawi region, <em>Labeo mesops</em> is a total spawner that runs up temporary streams when in spate to breed. The character of these streams changed dramatically with increased human populations and deforestation. The streams are now flash flood streams, rather than running for several weeks at a time. <em>Labeo </em>eggs are either smothered in silt or left high and dry. The loss of suitable spawning habitat is considered to be a major reason for the collapse (Skelton <em>et al.</em> 1991). This is compounded by overexploitation. Until the 1960s&#160;the species was one of the most important commercial species in Lake Malawi but is extremely rare. Basket traps, fish weirs, seine nets and gill nets were used to catch this fish."

Habitat management involves a logging ban, control of exotic plants, fire breaks, better control of hunting, curbing of tourism (Thiollay and Probst 1999)<strong></strong>, and action to reduce deer numbers (Le Corre and Safford 2001)<strong></strong>. Maturing plantations of <em>Cryptomeria</em> are being progressively replaced with native <em>Acacia</em> (Thiollay and Probst 1999)<strong></strong>. In 2006, an awareness campaign to reduce littering and promote recycling had been planned (T. Ghestemme <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. In 2004, a species action plan was published with the aim of reversing the trend towards extinction by increasing the numbers of females in the population, eventually doubling the number of females over the course of 10 years and achieving a viable population of 125 pairs (Salamolard and Ghestemme 2004). Experimental rat and cat control was initiated in the Roche Ecrite reserve prior to the 2005-2006 breeding season (Ghestemme 2005b)<strong></strong>, through the setting of poisoned baits, accompanied by the trapping of rats and cats to monitor their populations (T. Ghestemme <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Fouillot <em>et al. </em>2013). In the 2005-2006 breeding season, four out of five pairs in sites with predator control raised young, compared with two out of six pairs in uncontrolled sites (T. Ghestemme <em>in litt.</em> 2006). The control programme was carried out at 11 nest sites during the 2006-2007 breeding season; however three females disappeared, and six out of the eight remaining pairs produced young (T. Ghestemme <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. In 2007, the total number of young fledged increased to 22, with a breeding success of 91% at sites with predator control (compared to around 30% at those without) (T. Ghestemme <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. In 2010, predator control measures by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Etudes Ornithologiques de La R\u00e9union (SEOR), with some support from the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme, were on-going (D. Fouillot<em> in litt</em>. 2010), and rats have been cleared from 700ha due to the collaboration between SEOR, Reunion National Park and French National Forestry Agency (Life + Cap Dom 2015). A revised species action plan for 2012-2016 was being finalised in 2012 (A. Cheke <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt. </span>2012).<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Thoroughly research the ecology of this species. Continue habitat management. Continue and expand predator control by protecting nests from rats using poisoned baits and metallic bands around tree trunks. Control rats, cats and deer (Salamolard and Ghestemme 2004). Assess the conditions needed for successful establishment of a new population. Consider experimental translocation to a suitable lowland site such as Marelongue Nature Reserve (Thiollay and Probst 1999)<strong></strong>, as well as other areas suspected to have been formerly occupied by the species (Salamolard and Ghestemme 2004). Ensure that the action plans for the nature reserve and conservation of the species are consistent and compatible (Salamolard and Ghestemme 2004). Study the species's demography (Salamolard and Ghestemme 2004, Ghestemme and Salamolard 2007)<strong></strong> and establish captive-breeding populations for future supplementation/reintroductions. Following actions all proposed by Salamolard and Ghestemme (2004): Combat poaching, in part through education campaigns. Prevent actions by people that exacerbate the predator problem, including the dropping of litter, through awareness campaigns. Protect additional habitat both presently and potentially occupied by the species. Carry out research into the threat of disease. Consider supplementary feeding trials. Control invasive plants. Restore burnt areas. Take measures to reduce disturbance.    <p></p>",

The population may be limited by habitat quality and food resources (Ghestemme and Salamolard 2007)<strong></strong>. In addition, intrinsic factors such as limited dispersal and low genetic variability may affect the population (Ghestemme and Salamolard 2007); yet while the population shows low genetic diversity, there is no evidence to show it is significantly inbred (Salmona <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>.

Reintroduction work has continued through the efforts of the Friends of the National Park Foundation (I. G. N. Bayu Wirayudha <em>in litt.</em> 2012). By the end of 2009, 65 birds had been released at Nusa Penida Island and at least 62 chicks were reported to have fledged in the wild up to 2011 (Collar <em>et al. </em><span class=\"style12\">2012). In 2006, a local regulation was passed to make protection of birds obligatory by all village residents on Nusa Penida, in return for support including local education and sustainable livelihoods projects (Friends of the National Parks Foundation <em>undated</em>). A government scheme allows locals to get captive birds on 'breeding loan' and give a small proportion of the offspring to Bali Barat National Park and sell the rest commercially (Collar <em>et al. </em><span class=\"style12\">2012). As many as 126 birds have been released in the park, but these have been 'hard releases' with no subsequent monitoring of survival (Collar <em>et al. </em><span class=\"style12\">2012). In addition, the Wildlife Conservation Society continues to operate wildlife crime market and trade surveillance, as well as enforcement at key trading hubs in Indonesia (N. Brickle <em>in litt</em><span class=\"style12\"><em>.</em> 2007). Soft releases with provision of food, water and nest boxes have recently taken place at four resorts along the north coast (Collar <em>et al. </em><span class=\"style12\">2012). Three more releases were scheduled for 2014 (Begawan Foundation 2014).<br/> <br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Continue to monitor population trends closely, in particular to determine whether released birds are breeding successfully. Improve genetic diversity of released populations by introducing unrelated individuals. Commence strict implementation of the Bali Starling Recovery Plan. Continue to monitor the success of the reintroduced populations at all release sites, in particular investigating interactions with native flora and fauna, as well as with local agricultural activity. Encourage community work to improve habitat conditions (I. G. N. Bayu Wirayudha <em>in litt. </em>2012).</span></span></span></p>  <span class=\"style12\"><span class=\"style12\"><span class=\"style12\"><span class=\"style12\"><span class=\"style12\"><span

It has perhaps long been uncommon. Numbers in the early 1900s, when the species was discovered, have been retrospectively guessed at 300-900 individuals, although this is thought to be a gross underestimate. Since then, it has declined drastically in population and range. Illegal poaching reduced numbers to a critically low level in 1990, when the wild population was estimated at c. 15 birds. Conservation intervention, coupled with the release of a few captive-bred birds, raised this to between 35 and 55. However, despite excellent breeding success and continuing conservation efforts, the population continues to fluctuate, falling to six birds in 2001 (P. Benstead <em>verbally </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Continuing releases have raised numbers in West Bali National Park, such that surveys in March 2005 found 24 individuals (P. Wood <em>in litt.</em> 2005). In 2008, the population there was believed to be around 50 birds (G. Dijkman <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007, 2008). However, it is uncertain how many of these released birds have bred successfully in the wild and can be regarded as \"mature individuals\" following IUCN guidelines. A population derived from captive individuals has been introduced on Nusa Penida Island (which is apparently not part of the native range). This population appears to have adapted to the island and is breeding, with a total of 65 adults and 62 young present in 2009 (G. Dijkman <em>in litt</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. There have been releases elsewhere (Collar <em>et al. </em>2012), and the species appears to be doing well at at least one of these sites (Marsden 2017). Around 1,000 individuals are believed to survive in captivity.

This threat continues, despite the fact that the whole population is now confined within a national park and has been the subject of a specific conservation programme. The park and programme have, however, suffered from repeated mismanagement and corruption. In 1999, while black-market prices for the species soared (US$2,000 in mid-1990s), an armed gang stole almost all the 39 captive individuals awaiting release into the wild from the park. These serious problems are compounded by habitat loss. With the population now at such a critically low level, other threats may include genetic erosion, interspecific competition, natural predation and disease. Trapping is recently suspected to have taken place among the released population at Nusa Penida Island (M. Halaouate <em>in litt. </em>2013).

Here we endorse the latter assessment that <em>Limia </em>should be considered a valid, separate genus.<br/><br/>The taxonomic role of genera to express relationships among species is clearly justified in the case of <em>Limia </em>from different points of view. From the biogeographic point of view, species of <em>Limia </em>show  a discrete distribution since they are only found in the Antilles,  specifically on Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and the island of Grand  Cayman. However, only three species of <em>Poecilia sensu strictu </em>occur in this region and they are restricted exclusively to Hispaniola. In addition, recent phylogenetic analyses have found <em>Limia </em>to be a monophyletic group probably originated from a South American ancestor with the three Hispaniolan <em>Poecilia </em>species mentioned above representing the closest sister group (Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al.</em> 2016). A very detailed analysis is currently in prep, also confirming <em>Limia </em>as monophyletic (Spikes <em>et al.</em>  in prep). Moreover, there is enough morphological distinctiveness in  characters with adaptive value such is the case of gonopodial traits to  separate species of <em>Limia </em>and <em>Poecilia </em>(Rivas 1978). Furthermore, all of the existing ecological and behavioral literature is using <em>Limia</em>, not <em>Poecilia</em>.

However, most of the historic sites and other streams in the region have undergone substantial alteration and suffered significant habitat disturbance through clearance of vegetation, grazing and timber harvesting (H.B. Hines pers. comm.). Introduced predatory fish species (Eastern Gambusia <em>Gambusia holbrooki</em> and salmonids) occur in streams formerly occupied by the species and might have displaced frog populations by predation upon larvae (Gillespie and Hines 1999). Given the vulnerability of other members of the <em>L. citropa</em> group to trout predation, these fish are likely to have had a significant impact on populations of this species. In addition, chytridiomycosis cannot be ruled out as a cause of the decline."

Another population was later reported from the north side of Lake Enriquillo, La Azufrada. The latter population was apparently lost to changes in Lake level. Another record from the village of Cabral is from a freshwater habitat. Clarification of the taxonomic and conservation status of this species is urgently needed.<br/><br/>Even though some previous studies have treated <em>Limia </em>as one of the multiple subgenera in the genus <em>Poecilia </em>(Rosen and Bailey 1963, Meredith<em> et al. </em>2010, Meredith<em> et al. </em>2011), several other works have supported the generic classification for <em>Limia </em>(Rodriguez 1997, Hamilton 2001, Poeser 2003, Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al. </em>2016). Here we endorse the latter assessment that <em>Limia </em>should be considered a valid, separate genus.<br/><br/>The taxonomic role of genera to express relationships among species is clearly justified in the case of <em>Limia </em>from different points of view. From the biogeographic point of view, species of <em>Limia </em>show  a discrete distribution since they are only found in the Antilles,  specifically on Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and the island of Grand  Cayman. However, only three species of <em>Poecilia sensu strictu </em>occur in this region and they are restricted exclusively to Hispaniola. In addition, recent phylogenetic analyses have found <em>Limia </em>to be a monophyletic group probably originated from a South American ancestor with the three Hispaniolan <em>Poecilia </em>species mentioned above representing the closest sister group (Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al.</em> 2016). A very detailed analysis is currently in prep, also confirming <em>Limia </em>as monophyletic (Spikes <em>et al.</em>  in prep). Moreover, there is enough morphological distinctiveness in  characters with adaptive value such is the case of gonopodial traits to  separate species of <em>Limia </em>and <em>Poecilia </em>(Rivas 1978). Furthermore, all of the existing ecological and behavioral literature is using <em>Limia</em>, not <em>Poecilia</em>. Not recognizing <em>Limia </em>as a separate genus from <em>Poecilia </em>may obscure their similarities and cause even more confusion in a group that in fact deserves more taxonomic attention. <br/></p>",

Sulphide-adapted poeciliids exhibit a number of behavioral, morphological, and physiological modifications to facilitate sulphide tolerance, including surface respiration, increased gill surface area and head size, up-regulation of enzymes involved in oxidative sulphide detoxification, and shifts in trophic ecology to include sulphur-metabolizing bacteria (Greenway&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Barts&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

A similar situation occurs at the head of La Zurza Spring, which has been converted into a series of pools that are utilized by a local resort to attract tourism (Eliacin 2003). Deforestation associated with charcoal production occurs in areas around Lake Enriquillo, despite existing protections (Posner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Le\u00f3n&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).

The African Forest Elephants which occur in transboundary populations require that matters of sovereignty are considered when national populations are being presented for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across the range of both African elephants; this includes 29 sites in 15 range countries of the African Forest Elephant (<a href=\"http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike\">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020). Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and Nigeria do not have MIKE sites for their African Forest Elephant populations. The MIKE programme provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019). However, metrics used by the MIKE programme that depend on carcass finds are less statistically sensitive and reliable in the closed canopy forest habitat because detection of carcasses is difficult and decomposition in humid environments is relatively rapid. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level the implementation of National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a practical tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=\"http://cites.org/eng/niaps\">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020); six of these are range countries of the African Forest Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level African Forest Elephants are subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 20 range states, with most granting them the highest possible protection status. However, up to 70% of the animals may live outside protected areas (Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2013) and are vulnerable to poaching, as the degree of protection (by anti-poaching agents) and road access are both important predictors of their density (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Yackulic <em>et al</em>. 2011, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through legislation, policy and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management has resulted in the maintenance of numbers of African Forest Elephants in some localities. In other instances where protection efforts have failed, African Forest Elephant numbers have been reduced by 70% or more in a decade (ANPN, WCS, and WWF 2013; Nzooh Dongmo <em>et al</em>. 2016; Poulsen<em> et al</em>. 2017).</p>",

An assessment of African Forest Elephants in the central African range (representing approximately 95% of their present geographic range) estimated an overall decline of 62% between 2002 and 2011 with 72% of the remaining population being located in Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",

Analysis of estimates from 161 localities across the species range indicates a reduction of more than 80% of the continental population in the past three generations (93 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform with some subpopulations increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 31 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on findings from demographic studies on GL for African Forest Elephants on the basis of a 23-year study in Central African Republic (Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction such as habitat loss due to human population expansion have not ceased, are projected to increase in coming decades and are unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data. Density and distribution estimates for the African Forest Elephant across its continental range vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and certainty. Few credible site-specific estimates exist prior to the 1980s, and there is no available estimate for the species' population across its combined central and west African range. For this assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1922 (see Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was not informative. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the extent of the survey data used in the assessment, we made the assumption that the continental population of three generations back (1922) is equal to that of one generation back (1984). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 31 to 93 years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering one to two generations back and one to two forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.).

In the 2008 Assessment, the Central African region, which consists mainly of Forest Elephant range plus Savanna Elephant range in Cameroon, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was considered Data Deficient.<br/><br/>In an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, the African Elephant was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994).</p>",

The Asian and African ancestral lineages diverged approximately seven million years ago, and the African Savanna and African Forest ancestral lineages began diverging approximately one million years later (Rohland&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Brandt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Roca&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Meyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Palkopoulou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). The Third Edition of \u2018Mammal Species of the World\u2019 (Wilson and Reeder 2005) was the first to formally designate the African elephant as these two separate species. Recent genetic findings also support this designation (Roca&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Ishida&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Mondol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Palkopoulou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Kim and Wasser 2019). Hybridization between the two species appears restricted and evident at only 14 of the more than 100 localities recently examined across the vast forest-savanna ecotone. In nine of these 14 localities, hybrid individuals occurred alongside non-hybrid individuals of either one species or the other and not both (i.e., three localities had hybrids and African Forest Elephants only and assigned as this species; six localities had hybrids and African Savanna Elephants only and assigned as this species). For the IUCN Red List assessments, a distribution map published in Mondol&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015) and recent data by Kim and Wasser (2019) are used to assign localities as range of either&#160;<em>L. africana</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>L. cyclotis</em>.",

      "text_habitat": "<p>African Forest Elephants are found across the Guineao-Congolian tropical forests of west and central Africa stretching from remnant habitat in the northwest in Guinea and Sierra Leone (10 \u00b0 North, 12\u00b0 West) to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (4\u00b0 South, 29\u00b0 East). They occupy a variety of forest habitats including lowland humid forest on terra firma, swamp forests, the lower reaches of Afro-montane forests, dry forests and forest-savanna mosaics. They have a wide altitudinal range from the littoral forests along the Atlantic coast to about 2,000 metres in the Albertine Rift.<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are capable of moving long distances and may do so regularly, usually depending on fruiting events and a requirement for mineral salts. African Forest Elephants also demonstrate range residence and regular movement patterns with home ranges varying between less than 10 km<sup>2</sup> to more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Schuttler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Their movements are largely predicted by human pressure such as roads and villages rather than by vegetation type (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Molina-Vacas <em>et al</em>. 2019). Fifteen African Forest Elephant subpopulations (seven of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including more than 25,000 African Forest Elephants in the three-country TRIDOM landscape where a transfrontier management agreement is formalized between Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and Gabon (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017). Such management agreements also exist for the WAP complex in Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Niger, and for the Sangha Tri-National Landscape in Cameroon, Congo, and the Central African Republic.<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Specific ecosystem services provided by both species of African elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert) specific conditions on the ground and geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). African Forest Elephants are highly frugivorous and are instrumental in dispersing many tree species (Blake 2009, Terborgh 2016). They are obligate seed dispersers for some tree species (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Campos Arceiz and Blake 2011, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013) and particularly the seeds of large trees which tend to have high carbon content (Stephenson<em> et al</em>. 2014). The loss of the largest herbivores has repercussions on carbon storage in Amazonia (Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016) and the same may occur in Africa. African Forest Elephants create and maintain forest clearings in mineral-rich soil on which a wide variety of African forest fauna depend; they distribute the limited micronutrients available in \u201cbais\u201d to outlying areas (Turkalo and Fay 1995, 2001; Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2013; Cromsigt <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are an important symbol within the cultures of many African communities. African elephants (both species combined) are one of the few iconic animals that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>", 
      "threats": "Poaching for ivory is currently the principal cause of death of African Forest Elephants (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016) with persistent poaching pressure at many sites evident from their first surveys in the 1970s to the present day (Douglas-Hamilton 1989, Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1993, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 \u2013 an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times (CITES 2018, 2019).<br/><br/>Rapid land use change, driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat, is an increasing threat to African elephants across their range. Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A specific manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Ngama <em>et al</em>. 2016). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=\"http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/\">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat."

Little or no water reaches the Assyrian villages and agriculture correspondingly suffers. The availability of fish, an important source of protein in the Khabur diet, has also been seriously impacted.

      "geographic_range": "The species occurs in extremely low numbers at a few highly disjunct localities in south-central <strong>Brazil</strong>, northeast <strong>Argentina </strong>and possibly<strong> Paraguay</strong>. The species's stronghold is in and (mostly) around Serra da Canastra National Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil (Lamas 2006, Lins <em>et al</em>. 2013), where recent surveys yielded a rough estimate of 70-100 territories, roughly equivalent to 140-200 mature individuals (L. V. Lins unpubl. data); if confirmed this would represent a significant increase to the size of the largest known subpopulation. Tributaries of the Rio S\u00e3o Francisco  in west Bah\u00eda were thought to hold a significant population<strong> </strong>(Pineschi  and Yamashita 1999), but a 2003 survey there failed to locate any birds.  It has recently been found in Patroc\u00ednio municipality, Minas Gerais (I. Lamas <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012); a record from Itacolomi State Park in the same state is though thought to refer to an accidental or escaped bird  (Arvelino de Paula 2008, L. V. Lins <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). In Goi\u00e1s, there are records from Emas and Chapada dos Veadeiros national parks; the latter being surveyed in 2003-2004 with birds found just outside the park in the Rio das Pedras, and the total in the area thought to number fewer than 50 individuals (Disconzi 2012). In 1995, a small population was discovered on the Rio Tibagi, Paran\u00e1<strong> </strong>(Anjos <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 1997), but searches in 1998 were unsuccessful<strong> </strong>(L.F. Silveira<em> in litt. </em>1999). In 2002, another small population was discovered on the Rio Novo, in Jalap\u00e3o State Park, Tocantins (Braz <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2003), and six expeditions in 2007 and 2008 surveying a c.55 km stretch of the Rio Novo located three breeding pairs (Barbosa and Almeida 2010), and four pairs along 115 km of river in 2010-2011 (IECOS Brasil 2013 <em>per </em>L.V. Lins <em>in litt. </em>2013, Barbosa  <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">. </span>2015).

In 2017, a male was photographed in&#160;Serra do Mar State Park, Sales\u00f3polis, S\u00e3o Paulo, but this may have been a vagrant individual (Neto <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In Misiones, Argentina, 12 individuals were found on the Arroyo Uruz\u00fa in 2002, the first records in the country for 10 years despite extensive surveys (Benstead 1994, Hearn 1994, J. C.

      "threats": "Perturbation and pollution of rivers results largely from deforestation, agricultural expansion and, in the Serra da Canastra area, diamond-mining<strong> </strong>(Bartmann 1994, 1996; M. Diniz <em>in litt. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Previously, the species was thought to rely on gallery forest which, although protected by law in Brazil, has been cleared illegally throughout much of the species's range. However, evidence suggests it will occur on unforested, undisturbed stretches of river through 'cerrado'. All recent records of the species in the Serra da Canastra region refer to unprotected sites north of the National Park. These are sites under increasing pressure from mining, development of hydropower infrastructure and agriculture (L. V. Lins <em>in litt. </em>2013). Mining has ceased in the immediate area of its known range, but there is no additional habitat for dispersing birds<strong> </strong>(L. F. Silveira<em> in litt. </em>1999), and it is thought that diamond mining will resume at Serra da Canastra in the near future (L. V. Lins <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). Expanding agriculture and the construction of hydroelectric dams are considered the principal threats to the species (Braz <em>et al</em><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span> 2003). Dam-building has already caused severe declines across much of its range, and is increasing in scale (L. V. Lins <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). Tourist activities result in river perturbation and have been recorded within known territories and inside national parks<strong></strong> (Ibama 2006).<strong></strong><br/><p></p>"

In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20\u20131,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In S\u00e3o Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deep-water fisheries such as the gillnet fishery targeting monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>) there were considered to be over-exploited by the late 2000s due to governance limitations (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Planificaci\u00f3n Pesquera 2016). Overall, this smoothhound is subjected to intense and inadequately managed fisheries across its range, and there is very little refuge at depth."

The changed management resulted in a large increase in&#160;<em>P.</em>&#160;<em>australis</em>&#160;and consequent reductions in open-water habitats, decrease in dissolved oxygen, and increase in evapotranspiration - reduced habitat for all fish species (Kodric-Brown and Brown 1993, Kodric-Brown <em>et al</em>. 2007, SA DEW 2017, Gotch and AhChee unpublished data).</p><p>In 1899, exotic Date Palm (<em>Phoenix dactylifera</em>)<em>&#160;</em>introduced by pastoralists, proliferated at a number of spring complexes, with large infestations occurring at Dalhousie Springs (Gotch&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;2006; Fensham<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010). The potential for further spread is substantial. The extensive root mats and high transpiration of&#160;<em>P. dactylifera&#160;</em>reduces the expression of surface water in proximate springs. Drilling of bores for agricultural production occurred during the nineteenth century, creating thousands of free-flowing artesian bores throughout the GAB (Fensham<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010). There are currently two active bores nearby to the Dalhousie Mound Springs complex (Fensham<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010). Groundwater extraction has resulted in pressure head declines of up to 120 metres (GABCC 1998). As a consequence, spring flows in the discharge areas of the GAB have declined dramatically (Gotch<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). Further, between 2000 and 2011, declines in total wetland area across the GAB were observed (Petus<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). Given the dramatic loss of springs and the high concentrations of specialised organisms in remaining springs, it is reasonable to conclude that there have been substantial recent extinctions associated with aquifer draw-down (Fensham<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010). Furthermore, the area of habitat of many specialised plants and animals has been reduced at locations where springs are still active.</p><p>The Witjira National Park, including the spring complex receives, approximately 17,000 visitors annually, and the impact associated with tourism has also been recognised as a threat through trampling of wetland vegetation and practices associated with inappropriate bathing (i.e. soap, sunscreen and detergents) (Crowley and Ivanstoff 1989, Fensham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).</p><p>The invasion by alien fish such as Eastern Gambusia (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>) represent a major potential threat to&#160;<em>C. dalhousiensis</em>&#160;and other endemic species in Dalhousie Springs complex, with the most likely pathway via human-assisted translocation from&#160;<em>G. holbrooki&#160;</em>populations around 100km away (Gotch<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p><p>Climate change is expected to bring increased temperatures and decreased rainfall to the region where the Dalhousie Mound Springs complex occurs (Suppiah<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006). Potential implications of climate change include an increase in weeds and pest animals, a change in density and distribution of native plants, increased risk of extinction of vulnerable species, changes to the fire regime, and increased soil erosion.</p>"

It should be noted that even occasional hunting events of gibbons would be very detrimental to the species long-term viability and continued vigilance is required. Problems intrinsic to small, single populations may pose a significant long-term risk to population viability through inbreeding, disease outbreaks, extreme weather events and fires and climate change.

The habitat in China has been severely degraded by various human activities and the average canopy height is only 10.5 m (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Though primarily frugivorous, the gibbon diet is made of: 36.1% of fruits, 21.9% of figs, 16.9% of leaves, 14.4% of buds, 7% animals, 3% flowers, 0.7% plant parts. Invertebrates and lizards form the 7% of animal part of the diet (Fei <em>et al</em>. 2012). In China, the gibbons were seen to feed on 81 species, however, only 19 species provided 77.8% of the diet (Fei <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). They prefer fruit when fruit is abundant, and eat a lot of leaves in lean seasons. They also increase resting and huddle together in sleeping places in cold months (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012). These gibbons enter sleeping trees, on average, 88 minutes before sunset and leave, on average, 4 min after sunrise. They tend to sleep in relatively tall trees without lianas closer to ridges, choosing small branches close to the treetop. They usually move rapidly and straight to sleeping trees and keep silent once settled (Fei <em>et al.</em> 2012). Although these gibbons live in low karst forest, they display similar locomotion and feeding postures to gibbons living in tropical forest (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Yin <em>et al.</em> 2016). The fact the Cao-vit gibbon survives on karst forest probably does not mean that this gibbon is especially adapted to, or actually prefers, a karst forest over lowland forest, for instance. Rather, it appears that karst forest is more difficult to log and therefore is the last forest type standing in the original distribution area of the Cao-vit gibbon.<br/><br/>Similar to other gibbons, they tend to call in the early morning. On average, duets last 18.3 min and females produce 4.4 great calls per duet bout (Fan and Jiang 2010, Fei <em>et al</em>. 2010). Male calls showed great individuality and stability over a six year study period (Feng <em>et al</em>. 2014) They are diurnal and arboreal. Births mostly occur between October to February. The average home range of three focal groups was estimated at 130 ha (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2010), which is large for gibbons. They display a polygynous group structure of one adult male and one or two adult females with offspring. The average number of individuals in a group is approximately six (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p><p>      <span lang=\"PT\"></p>", 
      "threats": "<p>                      </p><p>  </p><p>The main threat to this species, given its restricted range, is habitat loss and degradation (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ho\u00e0n <em>et al</em>. 2016). What little remains of the species' habitat is under pressure from fuel wood collection, cultivation in valley bottoms and livestock grazing, especially of goats, by local Vietnamese and Chinese ethnic minorities. Hunting of this trans-boundary gibbon population has been controlled with the gazettement of protected areas in both Viet Nam and China and subsequent enforcement, although hunting of other taxa does still occur. It should be noted that even occasional hunting events of gibbons would be very detrimental to the species long-term viability and continued vigilance is required. Problems intrinsic to small, single populations may pose a significant long-term risk to population viability through inbreeding, disease outbreaks, extreme weather events and fires and climate change. A recent Habitat and Population Viability Analysis exercise by (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013) <span>suggested that the last remaining population of these gibbons may be reaching carrying capacity, making habitat restoration a significant priority.<span></span></p><p>  <span lang=\"PT\"></p>      <p><span class=\"apple-style-span\"><span lang=\"PT\"></span></p>"

Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, \u201c<em>Bsal</em>\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).</span></span></span>"

      "conservation_measures": "Dolphins in the Mekong River receive some degree of protection from the traditional respect afforded by local fishermen (Baird <em>et al</em>. 1994, Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2003).  Fishermen in Viet Nam worship whales and dolphins because they believe that the animals will aid them if they are in distress (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1997).  Most Cambodians and Laotians say that they do not hunt dolphins and believe that bad luck will result from killing them (Baird <em>et al</em>. 1994). The Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project was working with local fishermen at Chiteal Pool to reduce incidental catches of dolphins in gillnets, stop explosive fishing and manage aquatic resources in a sustainable manner (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1996). One practical measure was the establishment of a fund so that fishermen who found dolphins entangled in their nets and cut them free would be compensated for damages (Baird <em>et al</em>. 1994). However, this project has now stopped. Small-scale dolphin watching operations were established at Chiteal Pool (Laos/Cambodia border) in 1997, and this provided substantial income to a few local boat owners. However, due to the decline in dolphin numbers at this pool, the tour operations are now on the verge of collapse. Dolphin-watching also occurs at Kampi Pool and a project partially funded by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, UK, is planned for 2004 to manage the operations so that they provide maximum benefits to the local community (and thereby increase the value of the dolphins as living resources) while not adversely affecting the animals. <br/> <br/>In Laos, dolphins are legally protected from hunting, capture and trade, with fines of US$ 65-650 and imprisonment for three months to one year. In Viet Nam, all cetaceans are protected by a decree of the national assembly but this is not generally enforced. During the last three years, the Viet Namese government has been drafting a new law that will give authorities greater power to enforce fishery regulations (Perrin <em>et al</em>., in press). Approval by the national assembly is expected in the near future. No legal protection for cetaceans currently exists in Cambodia. However, a fisheries law is being drafted that includes specific regulations pertaining to marine mammals and the Cambodian Department of Fisheries has proposed to formulate a Royal Decree for protecting the Mekong River dolphin population. <br/> <br/>The Mekong Dolphin Conservation Project (currently supported by the Mekong River Commission and Ocean Park Conservation Foundation) was initiated in January 2001. The aims of the project are to assess the Mekong Irrawaddy dolphin population, initiate conservation and management efforts, and build capacity among local government officials. The project works in cooperation with the Cambodian Department of Fisheries, the Wildlife Conservation Society - Cambodia Program and Community Aid Abroad.",

      "geographic_range": "The Irrawaddy dolphin is patchily distributed in shallow, near-shore tropical and subtropical marine waters of the Indo-Pacific, from northeastern Australia in the south, north to the Philippines (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2002) and west to northeastern India (Stacey and Leatherwood 1997; Stacey and Arnold 1999). Its marine distribution is concentrated in estuaries and semi-enclosed water bodies (i.e., bays and sounds), generally adjacent to mangrove forests. Freshwater populations occur in three river systems - the Mahakam of Indonesia, the Ayeyarwady (formerly Irrawaddy) of Myanmar (formerly Burma) and the Mekong of southern Laos, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Irrawaddy dolphins also occur in partially isolated brackish or fresh-water bodies, including Chilka Lake in India and Songkhla Lake in Thailand. The first published record of the species in the Mekong was from the diary of a 19th century explorer (Mouhout 1966).  <br/> <br/>The effective range of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mekong River is a 190 km segment from Kratie (about 500 km upstream of the river mouth in Viet Nam) to slightly upstream of the Laos/Cambodia border at Khone Falls (or Lee Pee), which physically obstructs further upstream movement. During the high water season (June-October), anecdotal reports suggested that the dolphins ascended the Sekong River and its tributaries, the Houay Khaliang, Xepian (to Xepha Falls about 50 km above the Sekong confluence), Xenamnoi (to Tatkhek Falls about 8 km above the Sekong confluence), and Xekaman (to about 50 km above the Sekong confluence and including the Houay Twai tributary and possibly the Xepian). In the Sekong, the dolphins were reported to range as far upstream as Kalaum Town, Laos, about 280 km above the Mekong confluence near Stung Treng, Cambodia (Baird and Mounsouphom, 1997). Based on interviews conducted by Baird (1997) and Beasley <em>et al</em>. (2003), dolphins probably now only rarely, if ever, ascend these rivers. During interview surveys downstream from Kratie to Phnom Penh, children were unaware of the existence of dolphins, whereas adults reported that before 1975, dolphins were observed every day during both low and high water seasons (Isabel Beasley, pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Based on visual surveys conducted by Beasley <em>et al</em>. (2003), dolphins are frequently found during the low-water season in nine deep areas in the Kratie to Khone Falls segment. Approximately 2 km below the falls, dolphins regularly occur in a small (ca. 600 m diameter), deep (&gt; 50 m during the high-water season) pool, known locally in Laos as Boong Pa Gooang and in Cambodia as Anlong Chiteal. Dolphins were observed daily in the pool during the dry seasons of 1992-93, generally in groups of 2-10; 17 were seen at least once (Baird <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using visual and acoustic methods, Borsani (1999) estimated that there were 8-10 dolphins present in Boong Pa Gooang in late March/early April 1998. Other pools occupied by dolphins in the Kratie to Khone Falls segment are at Koh Suntuk, Kang Kohn Sat and Tbong Klar in the Stung Treng Province, and Sampan, Khasak Makak, Gopidau, Chroy Bantey and Kampi in the Kratie Province. Kampi pool, located 15 km north of Kratie, is currently considered the most important dolphin habitat in the Mekong, due to the 100% reliability of sightings, as recorded during 165 visits to the pool over three years, and the relatively large number of animals observed during each visit (mean group size = 7, range = 1-19) (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2003, Beasley, unpublished). <br/> <br/>Dolphins previously inhabited Tonle Sap (Great Lake) (Lloze 1973) but apparently have been extirpated there. Fishing is extremely intensive within the lake and in the channel connecting it to the Mekong. Researchers conducting extensive water-bird surveys in the lake from 1999-2003 have not observed any dolphins (Federic Goes, pers. comm.). Moreover, researchers from the Water Utilization Program - Finnish International Development Aid (WUP-FIN) Tonle Sap Modeling Project visited sampling stations throughout the lake every month from 2001-2003 and never observed dolphins (Juha Sarkkula, pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>The only documentation of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mekong of Viet Nam consists of a few records reported by Lloze (1973), skulls housed in whale temples near the delta and in the mouth of the nearby Dong River (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1997, Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2003) and a single carcass found in a fishing net in the Tien distributary near the Cambodian border in March 2002 (Chung and Ho 2002).  During a survey of almost the entire length (224 km) of the two main distributaries of the Mekong, Tien and Hau Giang, in April 1996, Smith <em>et al</em>. (1997) were unable to find a single dolphin.  <br/> <br/>During March and May 1997, Baird (1997) observed 40 dolphins in the segment of the Mekong from Kratie to the Laos/Cambodia border. He estimated, on the basis of surveys and interviews, that the total population in the Mekong was roughly 100 individuals. Beasley <em>et al</em>. (2003) conducted 11 boat-based direct-count surveys, traveling upstream from Jum Neight (about 30 km downstream of Kratie) to the Laos/Cambodia border during January-May from 2001 to 2003. All navigable channels were surveyed (zigzagging when widths were greater than one km and transiting through the center when less than 1 km). Unsurveyed channels were either too shallow or unsafe to survey due to high-velocity currents, which also meant a low probability of dolphins occurring there; interview surveys of local people living along these channels supported this assumption. The largest number of dolphins observed during an upstream survey conducted at the height of the low-water season in April 2003 was 64. This number was based on the sum of best estimates of group size, with a range of 55-82, according to the sum of low and high estimates of group size, respectively. A slightly different method was used during 2002-2003, traveling downstream in the same river segment but stopping for 10-30 minutes in the nine deep pool areas where dolphins had been observed during previous surveys. The maximum number of animals recorded using the pool-count method was 69 individuals based on the sum of best estimates of group size, with a range of 57-84 individuals based on low and high estimates, during a survey in May 2003. Paired observation experiments, using land-based survey teams and concurrent boat-based observations, were conducted during each of the pool-count surveys in an attempt to assess the proportion of dolphins missed by the boat-based team. This resulted in a 100% match between the two methods in terms of the number of dolphin groups detected in each of the nine pools and very similar group size estimates when experienced observers were present on both teams (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2003).",

      "population": "No quantitative estimates of population trends are available, but significant range declines in Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the Mekong mainstem below Kratie imply that the number of dolphins in the Mekong River has declined substantially over the past several decades. Also, for small cetaceans generally, it is recommended that yearly removals should not exceed 1-2% of the population size (Wade 1998) - the lower bound being more applicable to very small populations that are already vulnerable because of demographic and genetic factors. Four deaths per year (the mean number of carcasses recovered and determined to have died from gillnet entanglement in 2001-2003; Beasley <em>et al</em>. [2002] and Beasley [unpublished]) would represent 5.8% of the population, assuming a best estimate of abundance of 69, based on pool count surveys. Considering that the small size of the Mekong population already makes it vulnerable from demographic stochasticity, inbreeding depression and catastrophic environmental and epizootic events, the current rate of incidental mortality in gillnets will almost certainly lead to extirpation.", 
      "population_trend": "Decreasing", 
      "rationale": "The best estimate of abundance for the Kratie to Khone Falls river segment is 69 individuals, based on the pool-count survey in May 2003. This number is probably close to the actual size of the Mekong subpopulation because of: \n<br/>\n<br/>1) the low probability that dolphins occur below Kratie and in the Sekong River during the low-water season, and in Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and its connecting channel at any time, as indicated by interview surveys and the observations by researchers conducting water-bird surveys and hydrological investigations; \n<br/>\n<br/>2) the nearly comprehensive search coverage of navigable channels during vessel-based surveys; and \n<br/>\n<br/>3) the 100% match in concurrent detections of dolphin groups and close agreement in group size estimates by land-based and boat-based observers. \n<br/>\n<br/>Guidelines for considering measurement error (Annex 1: Uncertainty, in IUCN 2001) suggest using plausible lower bounds, rather than best estimates, to determine population size. In the case of Mekong dolphins, this implies that it would be appropriate to use 57, the sum of minimum estimates of group size from the May 2003 pool-count survey, as the estimate of abundance for this subpopulation. The threshold of 50 mature individuals for listing a species or population as CR according to Criterion D (and C2a(i)) refers to the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. Although the proportion of mature individuals typical for this species is unknown, it is reasonable (and certainly precautionary) to infer that the number of mature individuals in the Mekong River is less than 50. Therefore, the subpopulation qualifies for listing as CR based on Criterion D. The subpopulation also qualifies as CR on the basis of Criterion C2a (i,ii) as it certainly has fewer than 250 mature individuals, a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected or inferred based on the continuing known threat of gillnet entanglement and potential threats from water development and navigation improvement projects, and both subcriteria of subcriterion 2a apply (no subpopulation contains more than 50 mature individuals and more than 90% of the total mature individuals are in one subpopulation).",

      "threats": "Anecdotal reports suggest high dolphin mortality from deliberate killing for oil (reportedly for use in the motors of fishing boats and lamps) during the rule of the Khmer Rouge in 1970-1975 and then from target practice and the effects of explosives used for blast fishing during the Viet Namese occupation in 1975-1980. Dedicated studies on the dolphin population in 1990-1996 (Baird and Mounsouphom 1997) and 2000-2003 (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Beasley, unpublished) also recorded high mortality with a large proportion of the deaths caused by gillnet entanglement.\n<br/>\n<br/>Smith <em>et al</em>. (1997) noted the presence of several dozen 200-400 m long stow nets in the Mekong River mouth, followed upstream by more than 10 rows of nylon gillnets stretched across the entire channel, with only small openings to permit vessel traffic. Those authors suggested that dolphin bycatch and displacement caused by the nets could explain the lack of cetacean sightings during their survey of the lower Mekong in Viet Nam during April 1996.\n<br/>\n<br/><strong>Potential additional threats</strong>\n<br/>Numerous dams have been proposed for the Mekong River system. If built, these would degrade essential habitat features and interrupt the movements of dolphins and their prey. Of greatest concern are the large run-of-the-river dams proposed for the Mekong mainstem at Stung Treng and Sambor (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1996). In the Sekong River system, at least two dams have been proposed tens of kilometers below the reported upstream limit of the dolphins. Dolphins are also threatened in the Sekong system by the proposed Xakaman and Xepian/Xenamnoi dam projects. This last project would divert almost all of the flow from the Xepian River to a reservoir behind another dam in the Xenamnoi River (Baird and Mounsouphom 1997).\n<br/>\n<br/>Proposed navigation improvement schemes, which entail blasting the pool-riffle sequences that compose dolphin habitat, would probably lead to a dramatic decline, if not extinction, of the Mekong dolphin population due to the direct effects of the explosions and the indirect effects from eliminating or severely degrading their deep pool habitat. Prey declines from overfishing (particularly from the use of explosives and electricity) and unregulated dolphin-watching tourism may also be affecting the population."

The tiger population was estimated at 400-500 in the first and second national tiger action plans (Govt of Indonesia 1994, 2007a), and at 342-509 in six major protected areas (estimates from Shepherd and Magnus 2004).  However, incorporating more recent research, covering most of tiger estimated habitat (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) suggests the population could be higher (see Table 1 in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>There is no recent information from Berbak or Gunung Leuser, and both of these estimates are considered speculative.  Completion of a research in the three Tiger Conservation Landscapes in Riau province by Sunarto <em>et al</em>. (2007) will improve efforts to assess the Sumatran Tiger population.        <br/>   <br/>IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2006) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as \u201cindividuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.\u201d  While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also \u201cstress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.\u201d  Two factors which increase the tiger's vulnerability to extinction are their low densities (relative to other mammals, including their prey species) and relatively low recruitment rates (where few animals raise offspring which survive to join the breeding population) (Smith and McDougal 1991, Kerley <em>et al</em>. 2003).    Low densities means that relatively large areas are required for conservation of viable populations; it has long been recognized that many protected areas are too small to conserve viable tiger populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997, Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006).  Low recruitment rates also require larger populations and larger areas to conserve viable populations, as well as mortality reduction in non-protected areas to maintain population size through connectivity (Carroll and Miquelle 2006).   High mortality rates can be offset by an abundant prey base (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), but prey base depletion was considered a leading threat to tigers across much of their range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006).  The IUCN Guidelines advise that \u201cmature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.\u201d  Low recruitment rates indicate that fewer adults than would be expected produce new recruits.  Defining population size as the total estimated number of reproductive age adults in the taxon would also not take into account that many occur in subpopulations which are too small or too threatened for long-term viability.  Instead, the number of mature individuals is defined as equivalent to the estimated effective population size.  <br/><br/>Effective population size (Ne) is an estimator of the genetic size of the population, and is generally considered representative of the proportion of the total adult population (N) which reproduces itself through offspring which themselves survive and reproduce.  Ne is usually smaller than N, as has been documented for the tiger.  The effective population size of tigers in Nepal\u2019s Chitwan National Park was equivalent to just 40% of the actual adult population (Smith and McDougal 1991).  Therefore, the number of viable mature Sumatran tigers is projected to be 40% of the total estimated population, in the range of 176\u2013271 (based on the detailed figures given above), with no subpopulation having an effective population size larger than 50, following the precautionary principle in selecting the lower bound subpopulation sizes for Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser and Bukit Tigapuluh.  <br/><br/>The Sumatran Tiger is declining due to high rates of habitat loss (3.2\u20135.9%/yr; Achard <em>et al</em>. 2002, FWI/GFW 2001, Uryu <em>et al</em>. 2007) and fragmentation, which also occur, to a lesser extent, inside protected areas (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2007, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004, 2006).  There are high levels of human-tiger conflict (Nyhus and Tilson 2004, Browne and Martyr 2007), as well as illegal trade in tiger parts (Nowell 2000, Nowell 2007).   From 1998-2002 at least 51 tigers per year were killed, with 76% for purposes of trade and 15% out of human-tiger conflict (Shepherd and Magnus 2004).

Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2019). The population size is monitored annually. Research has taken place on the impact of invasive birds (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020) and on the species's genetics.<br/><strong><br/></strong>In 1998, rat control around known nests (using poisoning and tree-banding) was initiated (Blanvillain 2000)<strong></strong>. Rat control was subsequently scaled up, and was more successful when conducted throughout the year and over the entire valley (Gouni 2006). When control was confined to monarch territories only, re-invasions occurred on a regular basis (Blanvillain <em>et al. </em>2002)<strong></strong>.&#160;An extensive trapping programme of Common Myna and Red-vented Bulbul has been performed since 2000. This has involved shooting, poisoning and trapping within monarch territories and at the entrances to the range valleys (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, SOP-Manu 2018). This has led to the removal of thousands of birds, the elimination of the Common Myna and an increased nesting success of the Tahiti Monarch (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). In 2009-2011, 13 Tahiti Kingfishers were captured in the Papehue valley and moved to areas away from monarch populations, with the aim of reducing competition.

Control of&#160;<em>W. auropunctata</em>&#160;has also been undertaken.&#160;Following control measures, the area of the colonies was reduced by 85% by the end of 2018 (SOP-Manu 2018, Blanvillain 2019, Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>A Tahiti monarch sanctuary was established across its range valleys in 2013 as a Community-Based Protected Area, through an agreement between SOP Manu and several landowners of Tiapa and Maruapo, and the mayor of Paea representing the Papehue landowners (Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Regular and extensive control of invasive <em>Miconia </em>and <em>Spathodea</em> is ongoing within the monarch's range (<strong></strong>Raust 2010, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013)<strong></strong>. Other habitat restoration work has included propagating native mara trees and other indigenous plants in the field and in a nursery (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, 2015, SOP-Manu 2018).

Common Myna has been implicated in the predation of eggs and chicks while in the nest and probably following fledging, and may cause injuries to adults (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). Red-vented Bulbul has been implicated in reducing chick survival by disrupting the reproduction of paired Monarchs and competing for food and territories (Thibault&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Ghestemme 2011). Following extensive control measures, in 2018 it was noted that the Common Myna had disappeared from the range of the monarch, and the Red-vented Bulbul had become less common for the third consecutive year (SOP-Manu 2018). Control of invasive birds was shown to have resulted in increased reproductive success for the monarch (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>A more recent threat is the spread of Little Fire Ants (<em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\">) (M. O'Brien and C. Blanvillain&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2015). This invasive species is able to advance&#160;50 to 100 metres per year in colonies covering tens of hectares of land (Blanvillain 2019). It predates bird nests and competes with native species for food, and Tahiti monarchs have been observed to have deserted several territories following their invasion by Little Fire Ants (Bousseyroux <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). From 2012, three supercolonies eventually covering a total of 70 ha became established at the entrances of the valleys where the monarch is found (SOP-Manu 2018). Following control measures, the area of the colonies was reduced by 85% by the end of 2018 (SOP-Manu 2018, Blanvillain 2019, Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), but treatments have ceased and the Little Fire Ant has once again continued to expand its range (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>Other potential predators include cats and Swamp Harrier (<em>Circus approximans</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Ghestemme 2009)<strong></strong>. Tahiti Kingfisher (<em>Todiramphus veneratus</em>)<em> </em>is an aggressive native competitor which has been observed driving several monarchs off their territory (Ghestemme 2009)<strong></strong> and preventing colonisation of suitable sites by young monarchs (Ghestemme 2011).&#160;<br/><br/><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\"><span class=\"_Xbe kno-fv\">Invasive plants are a further likely threat, as forest on Tahiti is now largely composed of introduced invasive species such as&#160;<em>Miconia calvescens&#160;</em>and&#160;the African tulip tree (<em>Spathodea campanulata</em>), which have substantially modified the forest structure and ecology (Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013)<strong></strong>. As these plants invade forests, they reduce food availability for the monarch and facilitate the penetration of the forest by introduced birds and the Tahiti Kingfisher (Ghestemme 2009).&#160;Goat grazing has also led to habitat degradation and monarch population declines in the Maruapo valley&#160;(Ghestemme 2009, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013)<strong></strong>.<br/><span class=\"_Xbe

Populations south of Lake Toba were overlooked, even though a 1939 review of the species\u2019 range mentioned that orangutans had been reported in several forest areas in that region (Nederlandsch-Indische Vereeniging tot Natuurbescherming 1939). It was not until 1997 that these isolated orangutan populations were rediscovered (Meijaard 1997, Rijksen and Meijaard 1999). As a consequence of further sightings, published in 2003 (Wich&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003), a study of the southern populations started in 2005 when the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP) began a conservation project in the mountainous Batang Toru region with the intent of conserving the orangutan population and their remaining habitat south of Lake Toba.<br/><br/>The only known population of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> occurs in the uplands of the Batang Toru Ecosystem, an area of roughly 1,500&#160;km\u00b2 consisting of three forest blocks, of which 1,022&#160;km\u00b2&#160;is suitable orangutan habitat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> is the least numerous of all great ape species.<br/><br/><em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> was until relatively recently more widespread, with sightings further south in the lowland peat swamp forests in the Lumut area (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2003) and several nests encountered during a rapid survey in 2010 (G. Fredriksson pers. obs.). The forests in the Lumut area have in recent years almost completely been converted to oil-palm plantations. In 2008, a captive Tapanuli Orangutan was confiscated in Lumut. Observation were also made of a male orangutan in the Dolok Ginjang area, just north of the Batang Toru West forest block in the Adiankoting subdistrict in North Tapanuli, during a human conflict situation where an orangutan was shot at with an air rifle when it was found foraging on durian fruits (G. Fredriksson pers. obs.). Recent surveys in this area did not find any orangutan nests (Nowak <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>A hunting trip report from 1879 described orangutan encounters near the small town of Mantinggi, south of the current population (0\u00b058\u2019 N, 100\u00b00\u2019 E) (Kramm 1879). In 1902, orangutan signs and reports were noted along several small rivers on the south side of the Sibolga Bay, west of Batang Toru (Miller 1903). Unsubstantiated reports suggest that orangutans, presumably <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>, may have occurred even further south in Sumatra in historic periods. A number of museum specimens are claimed to have come from Padang, Palembang and Jambi (Schlegel and M\u00fcller 1839\u20131844,&#160;Beccari 1904, Hooijer 1948, Veracini <em>et al</em>. 2010), and an orangutan kill was reported in 1930 near Palembang and along the Musi River toward the base of the Barisan Mountain range (Delmont 1930). These accounts suggest that isolated individuals or small populations of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> may have survived outside the current range well into the 1900s, although without studying specimens from these areas, we cannot exclude that they could be <em>P. abelii</em>. Despite the distance to the south and their rarity, such reports are perhaps not surprising, as orangutans are long lived and isolated individuals or populations could potentially exist in fragmented landscapes for &gt;50 years, provided that food resources were available and stochastic processes were rare.</p>",

Its distribution is separated by around 100 km from the closest population of <em>P. abelii</em> to the north. A combination of small population size and geographic isolation is of particularly high conservation concern, as it may lead to inbreeding depression (Hedrick and Kalinowski 2000) and threaten population persistence (Allendorf <em>et al</em>. 2013). Highlighting this, a recent study (Nater <em>et al</em>. 2017) discovered extensive runs of homozygosity in the genomes of two <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> individuals, pointing at the occurrence of recent inbreeding.<br/><br/>Only about 10% of the geographic range is in an area recognized by the World Database of Protected Areas. Another 76% is in Hutan Lindung (Protection Forest), and 14% does not have any 'forest status' in the spatial plans, despite the fact that it consists of rugged primary forest with the highest densities of Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Ecosystem (SOCP unpublished data). This roughly translates to 8% of the total distribution located in nationally recognized conservation area (Cagar Alam, Strict Nature Reserve), 78% in Protection Forest (Hutan Lindung), and the remaining 14% of the range is entirely unprotected.</p>", 
      "population_trend": "Decreasing", 
      "rationale": "Due to high levels of habitat conversion and fragmentation, and illegal killing, <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in recent decades. Forest loss data indicate that orangutan habitat below 500 m asl of both <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> and <em>P. abelii</em> was reduced by 60% between 1985 and 2007 (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2011). It is thought that this reduction will continue for the Tapanuli Orangutan as forests within its range remain under considerable threat (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016). Significant areas of the Tapanuli Orangutan\u2019s range are seriously threatened by habitat conversion for small-scale agriculture, mining exploration and exploitation, a large-scale hydroelectric scheme, geothermal development, and agricultural plantations. Approximately 14% of the geographic range of the Tapanuli Orangutan is not protected, nor even allocated as forest estate, and even the protected areas are not immune from the above threats (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2011, 2016). The Tapanuli Orangutan is also hunted (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2012). Due to their slow life history, with a generation time of at least 25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009), orangutans on Sumatra are unable to sustain substantial and continual loss of individuals. A quantitative population viability analysis estimated that in 1985 there were ~1,489 individuals of the Tapanuli Orangutan, and that these would decline to only 257 over a 75-year period to 2060 (Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme unpublished data). With current management, the key threats of loss of lowland habitat and hunting are not being effectively reduced, and we therefore predict an 83% decline over the course of three generations. The species therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under criterion A4.",

The Nater <em>et al</em>. study showed that an isolated orangutan population in the Batang Toru region, which is the southernmost range of extant Sumatran Orangutans (<em>Pongo abelii</em>), south of Lake Toba, is distinct from other Sumatran and Bornean populations. Through a comparison of cranio-mandibular and dental characters from an orangutan killed during human-orangutan conflict to 33 adult male orangutans of similar developmental stage, the study found consistent differences between the Batang Toru individual and other extant Ponginae. Model-based approaches based on the analyses of 37 orangutan genomes supported the morphological results by revealing that the deepest split in the evolutionary history of extant orangutans occurred ~3.38 Ma ago between the Batang Toru population and those to the north of Lake Toba, while both currently recognized species separated much later at about 674 ka. The analyses show that there was a small gene flow between <em>P. abelii</em> and <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> until 10\u201320 ka. The combined analyses support a new classification of orangutans into three extant species.",

      "text_habitat": "<p>Despite a complex geological history, the underlying parent material within the geographic range of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em> consists primarily of recent (i.e., Quaternary, &lt;2.588 Ma) igneous rock, most of which is acidic volcanic rock from the Toba super-eruption of ~74 ka (Subardja <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oppenheimer 2002, Barber <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is in stark contrast to the north Sumatran Orangutan population that persists in forests atop older (i.e., Tertiary and above, &gt;2.588 Ma) igneous and sedimentary rock (Darul Sukma <em>et al</em>. 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1990d, Hidayat <em>et al</em>. 1990, Hikmatullah <em>et al</em>. 1990, Wahyunto <em>et al</em>. 1990, Barber <em>et al</em>. 2005). While comparative data in the format analysed for Sumatra are lacking for Borneo, previously published reconstructions of Borneo\u2019s geology highlighted a complex geological history that was in general different from that of Sumatra. This includes large swaths of landscape with pre-Cenozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock, with comparatively fewer areas characterized by igneous rock formations (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Using freely available WorldClim data (Hijmans <em>et al</em>. 2005), <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> can be differentiated from <em>P. abelii</em> by a highly narrow ecological niche, including a restricted upland elevation range (<em>P. abelii</em>: 701.7\u00b1454.8 m asl; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 834.4\u00b1219.3 m asl), cooler average temperatures (<em>P. abelii</em>: 23.3\u00b12.5\u00b0C; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 22.1\u00b11.2\u00b0C), and relatively high levels of average yearly rainfall (<em>P. abelii</em>: 2,435.1\u00b1460.5 mm/year; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 2,607.5\u00b1231.2 mm/year). Similarly, compared to <em>P. pygmaeus</em>, <em>P. tapanuliensis </em>occurs at much higher elevation (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 170.6\u00b1187.0 m asl; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 834.4\u00b1219.3 m asl), and experiences far lower average temperatures (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 26.0\u00b11.0\u00b0C; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 22.1\u00b11.2\u00b0C), and lower levels of average rainfall (<em>P. pygmaeus</em>: 2,827.3\u00b1420.9 mm/year; <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>: 2,607.5\u00b1231.2 mm/year). At SOCP\u2019s long-term monitoring station, average monthly temperature from 2009\u20132015 was recorded as 22.0\u00b0C (\u00b10.89\u00b0C, n=83 months), with a monthly range of 20.5\u201324.2\u00b0C, whereas average total rainfall from 2009\u20132015 was recorded as 3,654 mm per year (\u00b1390.0 mm, n=7 years), with a yearly range of 3,186-4,210 mm (SOCP unpublished data).<br/><br/>Provided that climate, parent material, and time are key factors in soil formation/quality, and thus forest productivity/quality (Tan 2008, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bockheim <em>et al</em>. 2014), the aforementioned factors are key distinctions between the <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> and most Bornean and north Sumatran Orangutan populations. A recent study showed that forest compositions experienced by <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> are at present mainly known from upland areas of southern Sumatra and Borneo, areas that notably do not currently maintain orangutan populations (Slik <em>et al</em>. 2011). They are largely restricted to primary forest, though they do venture into disturbed habitat at forest edges.<br/><br/>As noted by Wich and colleagues (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> was observed feeding on a number of tree species that had not previously been recorded as orangutan food species. These unique species include <em>Agathis borneensis</em> from the Araucariaceae family, <em>Gymnostoma sumatranum</em> from the Casuarinaceae family, and <em>Dacrycarpus imbricatus</em>, <em>Dacrydium beccarii</em>, <em>Dacrydium comosum</em>, and <em>Podocarpus neriifolius</em> from the Podocarpaceae family. To our knowledge, occasional feeding on species from these families had only been documented in Gunung Palung, Borneo (fruits of an unidentified <em>Agathis</em> species and vegetation of an unknown <em>Casuarina</em> species [Casuarinaceae]), and Ketambe, Sumatra (bark of <em>Sundacarpus amara</em> [Podocarpaceae]) (Russon&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In contrast, the five aforementioned conifer species (Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae) and one non-conifer evergreen species (Casuarinaceae) represent 21.9% of all feeding observations (n=58,558 two-minute instantaneous samples) recorded between 2011 and 2015 at SOCP\u2019s long-term monitoring station in the Batang Toru Ecosystem (SOCP unpublished data). Thus, a significant proportion of the dietary profile of Tapanuli Orangutans is markedly different from that of previously studied orangutan populations.</p>", 
      "threats": "Due to the extremely rugged terrain, external threats have been primarily limited to illegal clearing of protected forests, hunting and killing during crop conflict, and trade in young orangutans (Wich&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016<a href=\"#_ENREF_32\" title=\"Wich, 2016 #15187\"></a>). Encroachment and hunting have increased in recent decades, due to an influx of migrants from Nias Island, west of Sumatra, who settle on protected forest land on Batang Toru\u2019s forest edge where no land claims exist at present (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, despite land status changes from production forest to that of protection forest in 2014 (Ministry of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia&#160;2014), one company still maintains a controversial 300 km\u00b2 logging permit located in primary forest within the current range of <em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em>. In the southwest corner of the Batang Toru Forest Complex a gold and silver mine is located, which has recently converted <em>ca</em> 3 km\u00b2 of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> habitat and retains controversial mining permits overlapping parts of the remaining <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> range. Uncontested land speculation related to the company\u2019s exploration is further threatening the primary forest. More recently, a hydro-electric development has been proposed in the area of highest orangutan density, which could impact roughly 100 km\u00b2 of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> habitat, or nearly 10% of the entire species population. It could also jeopardize the chances of maintaining habitat corridors between the western and eastern <em>P. tapanuliensis</em> ranges, and with two smaller strict nature reserves, which could also maintain small populations of <em>P. tapanuliensis</em>."

The overall total global population increased after the re-establishment of the two subpopulations to a peak at the end of 2005 of nearly 34,000 but annual population maxima seem to have steadily declined since then.

Soaking and swimming, trampling, and limb-dipping (the dipping of feet or hands) have been recorded at all sites. <br/><br/>Natural threats include a susceptibility to stochastic events (unpredictable large disturbances), large population fluctuations, and genetic inbreeding.<br/><br/>Climate change may be responsible for the recent trend of thermal springs drying. For 14/19 past years, the Upper Hot Spring, a historically occupied thermal springs for this species, has ceased to flow. The only previously known drying event occurred in 1923, apparently due to the drought of the 1920s. For the first two known times, another historically occupied spring, the Kidney Spring, also dried in the years 2002 and 2011. Changes in precipitation patterns also most likely caused by climate change resulted in very wet years or years with unprecedented summer and fall rain events (2005, 2012, 2013) which in turn resulted in unprecedented snail population lows. As such, too much water may be just as bad as too little."

It has declined greatly since then, with increases in the range and abundance of the red shiner. The species now occupies not more than 12 percent of the estimated historical range (USFWS 2000).<br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, Woundfin have generally declined throughout their occupied range and critical habitat. They have been extirpated from the Lower Virgin River (i.e., from Beaver Dam Wash, perhaps from the Utah / Arizona State line, downstream to Lake Mead). Populations in Utah, particularly those upstream of the influence of red shiner (i.e., upstream of the Washington Fields Diversion), have persisted better than anywhere else (USFWS 2008).<br/><br/>Distribution and abundance have declined over the past 10 years or three generations (three generations is roughly 10 years).

Adults are generally found in habitats with water depths of 0.15\u20130.43 m and velocities of 0.24\u20130.49 m per second, whereas juveniles select areas with slower and deeper water, and larvae are found in backwaters and stream margins which are often associated with growths of filamentous algae (USFWS 2000).

Completion of Quail Creek Reservoir in Utah in 1985 was followed by a substantial decrease in the abundance and area of occupancy of the Woundfin.<br/><br/>Changes to flow patterns caused by dams and diversions have facilitated movement of red shiners upstream in the Virgin River (USFWS 1994). The non-native red shiner largely has replaced the Woundfin and has introduced the Asian tapeworm, which now parasitizes many of the remaining Woundfin (Heckmann et al 1986). Maintenance of a 26-kilometer red-shiner-free zone has required monumental management efforts, and the threat of red shiner expansion remains as prevalent today as it was in the late 1980s when red shiners became established in the upper river (USFWS 2008).<br/><br/>The Woundfin inhabits one of the fastest-growing parts of Utah, and associated extensive water development is an ongoing threat (Minckley and Deacon 1991). <br/><br/>Failure of a dike at Quail Creek Reservoir and a resulting flood of relatively enormous magnitude detrimentally affected the Virgin River Woundfin habitat (Hendrickson and Brooks 1991).<br/><br/>Primary threats are competition and predation from non-native species (primarily Red Shiner) and degraded habitat conditions (reduced flow/high temperatures) (USFWS 2008). Causes for the most recent decline in Woundfin numbers was attributed to the following suite of environmental conditions: continued drought with summer temperatures exceeding behavioural thermal maximum and critical thermal maximum; runoff from burned portions of the drainage; and the input of sediment from behind the Quail Creek Diversion Dam (USFWS 2008)."

This area is located in the forests associated with the Yacuma River, in southwestern Beni Department (Martinez and Wallace 2007, 2010; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013, Martinez and Wallace in press).<br/><br/>According to a recent assessment (Martinez and Wallace in press), <em>Plecturocebus olallae </em>has a restricted range (383.4 km\u00b2) in which forest coverage is around 54%. Not all the forest coverage identifiable from satellite imagery corresponds to tree-forest as there are shrub-forests not suitable for this species. Although forest types are not identifiable from satellite imagery, shrub-forests were found to be more than 60% of some forested areas. Population density estimations vary from 3 to 12 groups per square kilometres, with the lower values found in the larger forest areas where this species does not occur in taller forests. This shows that apart from the fragmented nature of forests immersed in a savannah matrix, not all the already scarce forest coverage is suitable habitat for Olalla\u2019s titi monkey. Though the distributional area is above the threshold for the species to be considered Critically Endangered on the basis of its extent of occurrence (EOO), it should be emphasized that according to the most recent data even previous considerations that one-third of the range of <em>P. olallae</em> represents suitable habitat (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) may represent an overestimation.<br/><br/>It is suspected that its area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality of the species will continue to decline at rates faster than historically seen, due to the paving of a road that lies adjacent to its small range. The paving of this road will exacerbate habitat degradation, which was already taking place at high rates primarily due to uncontrolled fires from agriculture. The recent approval of the Land Use Plan for the Beni Department (PLUS Beni), also promotes large-scale mechanized agriculture in the Llanos de Moxos representing a particular threat in areas with improved transport networks.<br/><br/>The region is highly sensitive to increases in forest loss and fragmentation caused principally by accidents during grassland burning applied in pasture management for cattle ranching (Martinez and Wallace 2010, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013, Siles <em>et al</em>. 2019). A 2016 study in Bolivia found that rapid frontier expansion for cattle ranching and agriculture, as well as extreme dry conditions (which may occur in the future due to climate change) could result in increased fire risk of 1.8 times higher than in 2010 in high-risk areas (Devisscher <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, the current paving of the North Corridor, a major road passing immediately adjacent to the range of <em>P. olallae</em>, represents a significant risk of habitat loss due to potential expansion of human settlements as well as changes in land use (Martinez and Wallace 2010, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013). This situation will be exacerbated by recent changes in the Land Use Plan for the Beni Department which openly encourage and facilitate mechanized agriculture in the region.",

Titis were relatively abundant in Naranjal, not encountered in Petaca (although local residents claim they occur there), and are no longer present in La Laguna (probably exterminated through hunting). Examination of holotypes indicates that groups encountered in Rio Yacuma were <em>P. olallae</em>, while two of three groups found in Naranjal were <em>P. modestus</em> (the third appeared to combine characters from both species).<br/><br/>Lopez-Strauss (2008) estimated density for both <em>P. olallae </em>and <em>P. modestus </em>using territorial calling behaviour and an adapted point-count methodology.

Although <em>P. modestus </em>is found in the same savannah ecosystem, <em>P. olallae </em>occurs in more humid forest associated with the Yacuma River and its seasonal flooding regime (Martinez and Wallace 2007, 2010). Martinez and Wallace (2007) and Lopez-Strauss (2008) details average group sizes of 2.7 and 2 individuals, respectively. The most recent assessment reports an average group size of 2.4 individuals (Martinez and Wallace in press).<br/><br/>A recent behavioural ecology study estimated the home range for <em>P. olallae </em>as 7.16 ha (Martinez 2014). The diet was mainly frugivorous, with leaves as the second most consumed item (L\u00f3pez 2011, WCS unpublished data). In heavily fragmented forests, terrestrial group movements corresponded to 7% of total group movements (Martinez and Wallace 2011). Similar terrestrial movements were observed when groups of <em>P. olallae </em>lost territories due to anthropogenic causes (smoke from grassland burning) and spatial competition with other primates (<em>Saimiri boliviensis </em>and <em>Aotus </em>spp.) (Martinez and Wallace 2011).", 
      "threats": "There is forest loss and habitat fragmentation within the range of <em>P. olallae</em>, related to the main economic activity in the region, cattle ranching, that manages grasslands as pastures using annual burning techniques (Wallace <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). Significant forest fragmentation was suggested as promoting terrestrial movements of <em>P. olallae</em>, increasing exposure to predation risks (Martinez and Wallace 2011). Uncontrolled fire during grassland burning to promote pasture regrowth can affect forest coverage, reducing habitat availability for <em>P. olallae </em>(Martinez and Wallace in press). Indirect effects of fire represent a threat for this species, as was observed in one group leaving its territory due to heavy smoke, when the grassland next to its forest patch was burned (Martinez and Wallace 2011). Critically, the ongoing major improvement to a regional road, The Northern Corridor, that passes close to the distributional range of <em>P. olallae</em>, implies high deforestation pressures related to potential new human settlements (Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006; Martinez and Wallace 2007, 2010; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013). The improved road could promote increases in cattle ranching and may increase hunting pressure too.<br/><br/>The disappearance of the species from the type locality\u2014La Laguna\u2014(Felton <em>et al</em>. 2006), and the rescue of a hunted specimen (Martinez <em>et al</em>. 2013) indicates that they may be threatened locally by hunting as they are used as bait for fishing. Spatial competition with sympatric primates such as <em>Saimiri boliviensis </em>and Aotus spp. may also be a threat to <em>P. olallae </em>(Martinez and Wallace 2011)."

Individuals are often observed basking on banks or fallen trunks along the shoreline, either alone or in groups including various size classes (Gallego-Garcia and Casta\u00f1o-Mora 2008; Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2008<a>). Smaller individuals tend to occur in shallower, more turbid waters or in flooded pastures, with adults more selective of deeper, wider channels (Gallego-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Mora 2008; P\u00e1ez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015a).<br/></a><br/>Nesting occurs in sand or gravel beaches, as well as in banks and pastures during the months of low river levels. Mean clutch sizes is 22 eggs, with a range of 10-31 eggs (Dahl and Medem 1964; Medem 1965; Casta\u00f1o-Mora 1986; Correa-Hern\u00e1ndez 2006; Cano 2007; Gallego-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Mora 2008).&#160;                  Based upon a sample size of approximately 1000 individuals (P\u00e1ez, unpubl. data) adult males on average measure 24.6 cm SCL (range 20-35 cm) with an average weight of 1.6 kg (range 0.7-4.3 kg), while adult females average 37 cm SCL (range 30-46 cm) and on average weigh 5.6 kg (range 2,2-10.4 kg). Hatchlings measure 42-46 mm SCL and weigh 16-22 gram. It has been documented that <em>P. lewyana</em> nests are laid in both the verano and veranillo low water periods each year, but it is not clear whether individual females nest in both periods each year. However, within each period, there is wide variance around the female size/clutch size regression. This often results in species where females of a given body size lay progressively smaller clutches when re-nesting during a nesting season. It is suspected that female <em>P. lewyana</em> in the study population deposited one or more nests during both nesting seasons each year.&#160;Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 20 cm SCL, corresponding to 3-4 years of age. Females first nest at 30 cm SCL, at an approximate age of 5-6 years old. The generation time is approximately 10 years (P\u00e1ez <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gonz\u00e1lez-Zarate <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ortiz-Yusti <em>et al</em>. 2014, S\u00e1nchez-Ospina <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zapata <em>et al</em>. 2014, Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gallego-Garc\u00eda and P\u00e1ez 2016, P\u00e1ez <em>et al.</em> 2015a,b).&#160; According to Gallego-Garcia and Forero-Medina (in prep.), <em>P. lewyana</em> has high site fidelity, with males and females exhibiting comparable home range sizes (10.3 ha and 14.6 ha, respectively). In the middle Magdalena drainage, the main nesting season is during the primary dry season, from December to April, with a peak in March, and limited nesting also occurring in the secondary dry season from July to August. In the Prado River of the upper Magdalena drainage, the main nesting period is from June to September and a secondary nesting period occurs from December to May (Vargas-Ramirez, unpubl. data). In the Sin\u00fa River, two seasons also have been documented in December to March and June to August (Gallego-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Mora 2008).</p>", 
      "threats": "<p>P\u00e1ez <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2012) provided and extensive review of the threats to&#160;<em>P. lewyana</em>.&#160;Several factors that affect populations of the species have been identified throughout its distributional range: 1) habitat destruction and pollution; 2) traditional utilization and consumption; 3) commercial exploitation; and 4) hydrological changes due to dams (Gallego-Garcia 2004; Vargas-Ramirez <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007b). Pastures and plantations have replaced original forest throughout a large portion of its territory. At urban centres and localities where extensive agriculture is the principal human activity (e.g., the upper Magdalena River), pollution of beaches and water bodies is common. <em>Podocnemis lewyana</em> is used as a source of protein for local people throughout its range. Various capture techniques are used, including hunting adult females with dogs on land during the nesting season, or in water by setting nets and hooks baited with plantain, or diving for individuals along the bottom of canals. In several fishing villages, turtles are also considered important for traditional medicinal purposes. In these communities, it is believed that consumption of turtles helps women to recover after pregnancy, cures skin and eye diseases, confers longevity and strength, and serves as an aphrodisiac. The nesting season includes Easter week each year, when hunting pressures rise notably to satisfy the demand for \u201cwhite meat\u201d in the large cities on the nearby Caribbean coast. In the lower Magdalena and Sin\u00fa rivers, some people exclusively dedicate their time to the capture, transport, and sale of turtles and eggs.<br/><br/><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">In the Sin\u00fa and&#160;tributaries of the Magdalena rivers (such as the Prado, La Miel, and Sogamoso rivers)<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">, hydroelectric dams have been constructed. Whenever water is released to produce energy during the dry season, beaches that were exposed become submerged. Flooding may last for several days and several of these flooding episodes may occur during a single dry season. The impact of these events has never been fully&#160;<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">evaluated but it is likely that thousands of eggs are inundated and drowned every year (Gallego-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Mora 2008).<br/><br/>W<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">hen neonates begin to emerge from the nests, they also are hunted with the objective of selling them in the illegal pet trade (Casta\u00f1o-Mora 1986, 1997; Rueda-Almonacid 1999). Moreover, habitat degradation caused by draining wetlands for agricultural or ranching ventures and the sedimentation of other water bodies seriously jeopardizes the survival chances of the species<em>&#160;</em>(Casta\u00f1o-Mora 1997, 2002; Rueda-Almonacid 1999).</span></span></p>"

      "conservation_measures": "All species of sawfish are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans commercial international trade in sawfish or their parts.<br/><br/>Within Australia, Largetooth Sawfish has the following conservation and protected status listings: Australian Commonwealth waters, Vulnerable (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999); Queensland, Protected (Fisheries Act 1994); Northern Territory (NT), Vulnerable (Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000); Western Australia (WA), Totally Protected (Fish Resources Management Act 1994). The take of the species is therefore prohibited within Australian Commonwealth, state and territory waters.<br/><br/>In addition to the above legislated regulations, the Commonwealth, Queensland, NT and WA all have fisheries management plans in place for interactions with protected species, including Largetooth Sawfish. These include mandatory reporting of interactions with these species, release of live animals, observer coverage of most of the fisheries (although this is very low in state and territory fisheries which are likely to interact with Largetooth Sawfish) and education programmes for fishers on identification and ways to minimise interactions with this species. The Queensland Government has published a guide to the safe release of sawfish for commercial fishers (DEEDI 2010) and NT shark fishers have a Code of Practice for the release of live sawfish from gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Several spatial closures in riverine, estuarine and coastal waters in the NT Barramundi Fishery offer Largetooth Sawfish some refuge from commercial gillnet fishing activities in the NT. Closed areas within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the closure of rivers in Princess Charlotte Bay to gillnetting may also afford some protection. Seasonal spawning closures for the take of Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) (mostly during the summer wet season) throughout much of the range add a level of protection to the species, however, information on Largetooth Sawfish long-term movement patterns and habitat use are required in order to assess the benefits of closed areas and seasons not specifically designed for sawfish.<br/><br/>In northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries, the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) is mandatory, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In one study, they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), however, they and other sawfish species are still being caught as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, awareness needs to be raised, and regulations put in place to protect all sawfishes and promote population recovery. While sawfishes (including Largetooth) are theoretically protected in India (Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act), threats continue with little beneficial management, although increasing awareness of sawfishes in India is encouraging. Largetooth Sawfish are also protected in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. Although protected in these range states, the lack of enforcement or specific fisheries regulations, and ongoing gillnet and trawl fisheries, means that the threats are ongoing.",

Although the St Lucia estuary system of South Africa was once an important breeding area, sawfishes (including Largetooth Sawfish) now appear to be extinct in that country. They also now appear to be absent from southern Mozambique (S. Pierce pers. comm. 2012) and while once common in the Zambezi River (Wallace 1967) no recent sightings have been documented. Madagascar, the Seychelles, Pakistan and India, amongst other Indian Ocean range states, have all seen depletions of sawfishes, including Largetooth Sawfish. Sawfish were previously common in artisanal fishing catches on the western coast of Madagascar, but are now extremely rare along that coast (Manach <em>et al</em>. 2011). There are no sawfish records from the Seychelles in the last decade (D. Rowat pers. comm. 2012), and a 2009 record of a Largetooth Sawfish in Gwadar, western Balochistan, Pakistan (A. Rahim pers. comm. 2012) represents a very rare event. Surveys with fishers in Raigad District (Maharashtra state) of India (where sawfishes were commonly harvested historically) indicate a drastic decline in the sawfish fishery from 1985\u20131990, with only occasional catches in recent years (R. Raut pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, localised depletions and extinctions of sawfishes have been reported or inferred from across the region. During some eleven years of market surveys (over 160 visits to 11 market sites) in various parts of Indonesia only two individual sawfish (both Largetooth Sawfish) were recorded which were caught in the Arafura/Banda Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2012) and possibly came from illegal fishing in Australian waters. Demersal elasmobranchs are intensively targeted in Indonesia (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009), and this extremely low occurrence (out of some 60,000 chondrichthyans examined) is indicative of severely depleted populations in Indonesia. In fact, it is thought that sawfishes are extinct from large areas of Indonesia. Despite the presence of sawfish rostra in houses near fishing ports, local Indonesian fishermen indicate that they have not seen sawfishes for more than 20 or 30 years (W. White pers. comm. 2012). Populations in Borneo are thought to be seriously depleted (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Sabah (Malaysian Borneo), fishers and villagers reported sawfish as abundant in the 1970s and declining sharply in the 1980s, with very limited catches since that time (Manjaji 2002). The last known record from the Kinabatangan River was in 1996 (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Datasets from as early as 1963\u20131972 showed the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979), which included the virtual disappearance of sawfish (Pauly 1988). Declines in demersal fishes in the Thai Andaman Sea were also documented (Pauly 1979) and these likely included sawfishes. In contrast, historic accounts indicated that sawfishes were \u2018common\u2019 and caught in \u2018considerable numbers\u2019 in Thailand, including in rivers (Smith 1945). Within the Cambodian Mekong system, numbers of Largetooth Sawfish have reportedly decreased considerably. Historically, they were regularly seen as far upstream as Khon\u00e9 Falls, and in other areas of the Mekong (Tonl\u00e9 Sap and Great Lake), none have been seen for \u2018several decades\u2019 (Rainboth 1996).<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish were considered common in the Philippines by Herre (1953) but none were recorded in more recent surveys and it is thought that the population \u2018has greatly declined in the Philippines\u2019 (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish had previously been described as common in the middle reaches and large tributaries of the Fly River, Papua New Guinea (Roberts 1978) but its status there requires reappraisal. More recently, the \u2018demise\u2019 of the species has been reported in Lake Sentani, West Papua as a result of the change from traditional fishing methods to the use of gill nets (Polhemus <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>All sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines in Australia. In places, viable populations persist, representing some of the last viable populations in the Indo-West Pacific, with Australia being one of a limited number of global strongholds for sawfishes (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005, DSEWPaC 2011a). Genetic data indicate that Largetooth Sawfish has moderate levels of genetic diversity and male-biased dispersal in Australian waters (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011, Phillips 2012). Genetic evidence suggests that females have strong reproductive philopatry (returning to sites previously used for reproduction), with maternal population structuring between Western Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the northern coast of the Northern Territory and the Queensland east coast populations also potentially forming distinct maternal populations (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011). In contrast, males disperse between at least Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria (Phillips 2012).<br/><br/>Species-specific data to accurately ascertain the status of Australian sawfishes is generally lacking and the evidence for decline and range contraction is largely anecdotal. Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program, which operates \u2018bather protection\u2019 fishing gear along the Queensland east coast, shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 30 year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern Queensland (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). All Pristis species are now extremely rare along the Australian east coast (the area in which human population and habitat modification is greatest) where they have undergone a considerable range contraction. Although populations across northern Australia have undergone significant reduction and their status is uncertain, Australian populations are considered some of the highest in the world.<br/><br/>While specific management measures are now in place in Australia, including full species protection, education of fishers about safe release practices, and fishery-specific management, threats are ongoing and there is no information to suggest that the population is recovering from previous declines.<br/>&#160;<br/>Across the Indo-West Pacific, a population reduction of \u226580% is inferred based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) over a period of three generations (i.e., 1969 to present). Declines and continuing threats (much of the species\u2019 Indo-West Pacific range, with the exception of northern Australia, is subject to intense human pressure, particularly through generally unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation in critical sawfish habitats) are resulting in the continual declines of remnant populations. The Australian population of Largetooth Sawfish likely comprises a high proportion of the global population (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005).",

      "text_habitat": "Available life history information on Largetooth Sawfish comes from in Lake Nicaragua in Central America (Thorson 1976; 1982) and from northern Australia.<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish are generally restricted to shallow (&lt;10 m) coastal, estuarine, and fresh waters, although they have been found at depths of up to 26 m in Lake Nicaragua. Largetooth Sawfish move across salinity gradients freely and in northern Australia, parturition probably occurs in brackish or saltwater and juveniles spend ~4\u20135 years in the freshwater reaches of rivers and floodplain waterholes before migrating to estuarine and marine waters (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2009, P. Kyne unpublished data).<br/><br/>The life history of Largetooth Sawfish, like many elasmobranchs, is characterised by slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, which generally contributes to a low intrinsic rate of increase. The maximum reported size of Largetooth Sawfish is 656 cm TL, although it has been estimated up to 700 cm TL (Compagno and Last 1999). Very large individuals are now rarely seen anywhere in the Indo-West Pacific.<br/><br/>The reproductive method of sawfishes is most likely lecithotrophic viviparity. The only known reproductive study of Largetooth Sawfish was from Lake Nicaragua in the 1970s (Thorson 1976) with other observations from northern Australia. Thorson (1976) found that both ovaries appeared to be functional, though the left seemed to be larger and carry more ova. Litter sizes in Lake Nicaragua were 1\u201313 (mean 7.3) following a gestation period of about five months. While the reproductive cycle is possibly biennial in the Western Atlantic (Thorson 1976), it appears to be annual in northern Australia (Peverell 2008).<br/><br/>Size at birth ranges 72\u201390 cm TL (Peverell 2008). Size at maturity is ~300 cm TL for females and ~280\u2013300 cm TL for males (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2008). Age at maturity in Queensland, northern Australia, has been estimated at 8\u201310 years (Peverell 2008). Peverell (2008) using a preliminary vertebral growth ring analysis estimated a maximum age of 35 years in northern Australia.<br/>&#160;<br/>Using life history information from populations in Central America, Simpfendorfer (2000) estimated an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.05 to 0.07 per year and population doubling times of 10.3\u201313.6 years. These rates were estimated under ideal conditions (i.e. no fisheries, no population fragmentation, no habitat modification and no inbreeding depression). Moreno Iturria (2012) estimated an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.12 yr<sup>-1</sup>, a population doubling time of 5.8 yrs and a generation time of 14.6 yrs for Indo-West Pacific Largetooth Sawfish.", 
      "threats": "The principal threats to this species are from fishing; it was formerly targeted, but is now mostly taken incidentally in broad-spectrum fisheries (CITES 2007). The long toothed rostrums of sawfishes make them extraordinarily vulnerable to entanglement in any sort of net gear, gillnetting and trawling in particular. The exploitation of elasmobranchs is high in many parts of the Largetooth Sawfish\u2019s range in the Indo-West Pacific, particularly in coastal areas and freshwater systems. Unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation all threaten sawfishes across the region. Considerable population declines and localised extinctions have been reported for sawfish species in the region.<br/><br/>For at least part of its life cycle, the Largetooth Sawfish relies on a variety of specific habitat types including freshwater systems, estuaries and mangroves; these are all affected by human development (CITES 2007). Agricultural and urban development, commercial activities, dredge-and-fill operations, boating, erosion, and diversions of freshwater runoff as a result of continued coastal and catchment development has caused substantial loss or modification of these habitats (CITES 2007). Mining activities, in northern Australia, New Guinea (e.g., the Fly River) and elsewhere, pose a risk to Largetooth Sawfish through freshwater habitat alteration or potential pollution events. Alterations to river courses are a realised threat to Largetooth Sawfish which migrate upstream in early life stages. These range from smaller barrages and road crossing in northern Australia to large-scale river alterations in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>In Australia, datasets indicate that net fisheries account for the greatest bycatch of sawfish (all species) across northern Australia (80.2%) followed by trawling (16.6%), line fishing (9.2%) and recreational fishing (0.3%) (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Largetooth Sawfish are captured by all these fishing activities (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004) and declines in Largetooth Sawfish are suspected based on potential levels of exploitation (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A survey across northern Australia from Western Australia to Queensland appears to support the assertion that fishing is responsible for declines, as it found greater numbers of sawfish in areas of lower fishing pressure (both commercial and recreational) (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The sustainability of Largetooth Sawfish populations in northern Australia is considered to be at high risk due to the cumulative effects of all fisheries, and the species\u2019 low biological productivity and susceptibility to gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>A number of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australian inshore net fisheries continue to catch Largetooth Sawfish incidentally. Despite requirements to release these, there is no doubt a continuing level of bycatch-associated mortality.<br/><br/>The extent to which recreational fishers interact with Largetooth Sawfish across northern Australia is unknown, but in some areas where the species has been recorded, recreational fishing is a popular activity, which is increasing in popularity and could pose a threat to the species. In the Fitzroy River (WA), recreational fishers have been reported killing incidentally caught Largetooth Sawfish for the \u2018trophy\u2019 rostrum and for retrieval of fishing tackle (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Sawfish (non species-specific records) have been recorded in derelict fishing nets in northern Australian waters; the Gulf of Carpentaria is a particular hotspot for these \u2018ghost nets\u2019 (Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2010) and capture in these may result in sawfish mortality. Because of their toothed rostrum, sawfish may be exceptionally susceptible to entanglement in other types of marine debris, and entanglement has been reported in a number of types of marine debris (Seitz and Poulakis 2006). Entanglement in discarded or lost recreational fishing line may occur on occasion, as has been documented for Largetooth Sawfish in Western Australia (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2004)."

The diet consists mainly of ripe fruits, seeds, flowers, and young leaves, their respective proportions varying according to seasonal abundance (Irwin 2008b). In the rainy season (November-April) ripe fruit and/or seeds can contribute more than 80% of the diet; in the lean season (May-October) this drops to about 20% and the majority of the diet is composed of leaves and/or flowers (Irwin 2008b; Irwin <em>et al.,</em> 2015; Kerker Oliver 2017; Powzyk 1997). Females are sexually receptive for very few days (perhaps only one day)<span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">&#160;out of the year, sometime between November and January. A single young is born between May and July, after a gestation of 179 days.&#160;Individuals may live up to 25 years in the wild. This species is diurnal and arboreal. In one study, these animals spent 54.5% of their time resting, 32.3% feeding, 5.7% moving, and 5.0% in social behaviour. This species has only twice been studied for a significant period of time (by Powzyk at Mantadia and Irwin at Tsinjoarivo). It lives in female-dominated, multi-male/multi -female groups of 2 to 8 individuals, consisting of 1\u20133 adult females and 1 or 2 adult males, and multiple females may breed within the same group. Home ranges of 20\u201380 ha are defended by means of scent-marking, although there is little home range overlap and little aggression over boundaries. Compared to the sympatric, similar -sized <em>Indri indri</em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">, <em>P. diadema </em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">spends more time actively patrolling and defending its territories. The mean daily path length of 987\u2013 1629 m for <em>P. diadema </em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">can be compared to 774 m for <em>I. indri </em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">(Powzyk 1997). As one of the largest lemurs, it is likely that their only natural predator is the fosa (<em>Cryptoprocta ferox</em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">), though it is possible that some large raptors may pose a risk, especially for younger animals. Predation by fosa may be an important threat to this species, especially in fragmented or degraded areas where other prey species may be reduced (Irwin<em> et al. </em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">2009). Males emigrate at roughly age five, often to a neighbouring group while females may either emigrate or remain in their natal group; most animals breed after five years of age but occasionally females that stay in their natal group have given birth at 4 years old (Mittermeier <em>et al.</em><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\"> 2010 and references therein; Irwin unpublished data).</span></span></span></span></p><p></p>",

However, hunting for food also can have a very serious impact on remaining populations, even within existing protected areas (Mittermeier <em>et al. </em>2010). Reports of hunting have increased dramatically since the last assessment, particularly in regions surrounding Andasibe and the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena, as well as northern parts of the species range. Furthermore, illegal rum production, necessitating the planting of sugar cane fields and destructive utilization of sifaka food trees, is a threat to populations in Tsinjoarivo (Irwin and Ravelomanantsoa 2004). The species is occasionally kept as a pet within Madagascar (Reuter and Schaefer 2017). Finally, the isolated nature of some protected but small populations (especially Betampona and Andriantantely) means that these populations might be non-viable over the long term without restoring gene flow or undertaking translocations.</p><p></p>"

The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has developed test mining equipment, which targets seafloor massive sulphides and at the time of this assessment is in the process of conducting verification tests (Shirayama <em>et al.</em> 2017). Polymetallic sulphide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation. As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Japan EEZ to be a significant threat to the species."

Predation of smaller seabirds by rats on Higashijima dramatically increased in 2005, attributed to a shift in the foraging behaviour of the rats (Kawakami <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Ministry of Environment responded to the mass depredation of small petrels by initiating a rat eradication program on Higashijima in 2008, which has apparently been successful, with no rats observed since 2010 (Kawakami <em>et al</em>. 2012). Rats are also absent from Kitanoshima Island, but remain in large parts of the species\u2019 range.

Invasive plant species, <em>Casuarina</em> <em>equisetifolia</em> and <em>Leucaena</em> <em>leucocephala</em>, may also have impacted breeding success on Higashijima, as they invade the breeding habitat and alter the environment (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The Forest Agency has eradicated almost all matured <em>C. equisetifolia</em> so far and is conducting an eradication program for <em>L. leucocephala</em>. Light pollution is another potential threat. It is a significant cause of mortality in Newell\u2019s Shearwater <em>Puffinus newelli</em>, and two of the six <em>P.</em> bryani specimens that were located in the Bonin Island prior to 2015 were collected after apparent disorientation due to artificial lighting."

The Twee River System has been identified as a priority freshwater environment for fish conservation (Impson <em>et al.&#160;</em>1999) and is listed as a fish sanctuary in the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) project (Nel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Conservation staff and researchers have made riparian landowners in the Twee catchment aware of the uniqueness of the river and its native fish fauna. Funding by the WWF Nedbank Green Trust enabled the implementation of the Twee River catchment rehabilitation project in 2014 which focused on alien plant clearing and creating awareness on improved agricultural practices with regard to deciduous and citrus fruit production. The removal of Cape Kurper from the Suurvlei River through the use of rotenone and the construction of a barrier weir to prevent re-invasion has been proposed by CapeNature (Marr <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). There are however concerns that agrochemical pollution and poor water quality in the river will prevent the recolonization of the treatment zone by Twee River Redfin from the upstream population and as a result this project has not been implemented yet.<br/><br/>Impson <em>et al</em>. (2007) recommended that suitable dams in the catchment be stocked with the Twee River Redfin to create additional refuges for the species.&#160;Jordaan <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported the successful establishment of Twee River Redfin&#160;in an impoundment following the experimental translocation of 48 Twee River Redfin&#160;to the Tuinskloof Dam in 2005.

      "population": "This highly restricted species is only extant in two subpopulations. The first is from a single quaternary catchment in the connected Heks, Suurvlei, Middeldeur and Twee rivers (referred to as the Twee subpopulation from hence forth). The majority of this subpopulation has been reduced by invasive fish and there is very little suitable habitat where alien fishes are absent (e.g., upper Suurvlei, Heks and Middeldeur rivers). Twee River Redfin (<em>Pseudobarbus erubescens</em>) is absent or uncommon elsewhere in its former range because of the impacts of two extra-limital species, namely Clanwilliam Yellowfish (<em>Labeobarbus seeberi</em>) (predator) and Cape Kurper (<em>Sandelia capensi</em>s) (predator and competitor). The most recent estimate for this subpopulation is 8,400 fish of which 4,100 are adults (Marriot 1998). Marr <em>et al.</em> (2009) did a follow-up survey using the sampling sites from Marriot\u2019s study but results are not directly comparable due to different sampling methodology (snorkelling vs fyke nets). Marr <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported that while the distribution of Twee River Redfin did not change compared to Marriot\u2019s study, there was evidence that the species is becoming less abundant and more localised in the lower Middeldeur and upper Twee Rivers.The second subpopulation originated as an experimental translocation in 2005 of 48 fish from the main Twee subpopulation to the Tuinskloof Dam, an impoundment that still falls within the Twee River catchment (Bills 2011). The fate of these fish were investigated in November 2015 and three fyke net efforts yielded 2838 fish (Jordaan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Length distribution data of a subsample of fish from the dam demonstrated an established population containing juveniles and multiple length cohorts of spawning-capable fish. Twee River Redfin&#160;can thus be considered fully established in this impoundment. The 2,838 fish sampled in this initial survey represent approximately 30% of the estimated population of this species in the wild based on the population estimate of Marriot (1998). As sampling effort was low (three fyke net efforts), population size in the 10 ha impoundment is likely to be considerably larger and may even exceed the source population in numbers. The conservation significance of this subpopulation from a genetic diversity perspective requires evaluation as the small founder population may have resulted in a genetic bottleneck causing low genetic diversity within the impoundment&#160;population versus the diversity in the Twee subpopulation (Jordaan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Two additional dams have since been stocked but these have not yet been surveyed to determine establishment. While the Tuinskloof Dam subpopulation is relatively large, the Twee River subpopulation is considered to be small compared with other redfin populations in the Western Cape. Both subpopulations are also isolated and the species is considered to have a severely fragmented population.", 
      "population_trend": "Decreasing", 
      "rationale": "The Twee River Redfin (<em>Pseudobarbus erubescens</em>) is endemic to the Twee River catchment and its distributions in its tributaries has declined since 1987. It is likely that the population decline started with the advent of intensive agriculture in the catchment in the 1960s and 1970s. These declines have been accelerated by the introduction of several species of non-native fish, and it is possible that at least a 50% decline has occurred since 1987, but this is speculative. More substantiated records are needed to apply criterion A. The area of occupancy (AOO) is 44 km<sup>2</sup> according to the IUCN protocol using a 2x2 km<sup>2</sup> grid overlay and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 82 km<sup>2</sup>. Although it is known from two subpopulations, one from the interconnected rivers in the Twee River System and the second from an introduced subpopulation to the Tuinskloof Dam, these subpopulations are both small and isolated hence they are considered severely fragmented. Criterion B applies because of the very small size of the species distribution range, continuous decline as a result of increasing levels of threat (invasive alien fish, habitat degradation) and the fragmented nature of the population. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under B1ab(i,ii,iii,v).",

      "text_habitat": "Adults prefer sheltered areas in pools, particularly near overhanging vegetation and caves formed by boulders. Juveniles are usually found in pools, forming schools in the upper water column, near palmiet (<em>Prionium serratum</em>) beds or beneath overhanging vegetation. Adults reach a maximum age of six years, maturing after two years at an average size of 45 mm in males and 42 mm in females (Marriot 1998). This species spawns in late spring (October) to early summer (December), with an asynchronous, iteroparous pattern of egg development (Marriot 1998). Females contain up to 400 ova at various stages of development (Marriot 1998). The body and fin bases of both sexes develop an overall reddish hue during the breeding season, with males also characterised by having small nuptial tubercles on the head (Skelton 1988). The diet of the Twee River Redfin is dominated by benthic invertebrates although adults frequently feed on drift material and terrestrial insects floating on the water surface (Marriot 1998).<br/>The successful establishment of the Twee River Redfin&#160;in an off-stream impoundment illustrates plasticity in life history traits of this species that enables it to successfully colonise novel environments. The available habitat in the impoundment was mainly sand and gravel substrate with rocks and boulders and no marginal or submerged vegetation (Jordaan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aquatic invertebrates were sampled from the impoundment as aquatic invertebrates are the primary food source of Twee River Redfin.", 
      "threats": "The biggest threat to this species is the presence of non-native fishes and several species have been introduced into the Twee River catchment. The first introduction was Cape Kurper, alien to the Olifants River System, but indigenous to most rivers of the Western Cape. A local farmer introduced Cape Kurper&#160;to an off-stream dam in the early 1980s in a misguided attempt to use an \u201cindigenous\u201d fish for mosquito control (Hamman <em>et al</em>. 1984). The species is now common and widespread in the Suurvlei River where it competes with Twee River Redfin&#160;for resources and adult Cape Kurper&#160;are also a likely predator on juvenile Twee River Redfin&#160;(Marriot 1998). Marr <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported that Cape Kurper&#160;has reached the full extent of its invasion in the Twee System and was the most widespread and abundant species in the Twee River.<br/>In the 1980s Clanwilliam Yellowfish<em>&#160;</em>(<em>Labeobarbus capensis</em>) was introduced above its natural range above three waterfall barriers into the upper and middle Twee River by the Cape Department of Nature Conservation in a misguided attempt to create a sanctuary for an \"indigenous\" fish (Impson <em>et al</em>. 2007). This species is now common and widespread, particularly in the lower Twee River. Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and Bluegill Sunfish (<em>Lepomis macrochirus</em>) were illegally stocked into the catchment in the 1990s, and have invaded the Twee River, where they appear to be present in low numbers as a result of high summer water temperatures (26\u00b0C, a deterrent to trout) and strong winter flows (a deterrent to Bluegill Sunfish).&#160;<br/>The establishment of a viable population of Twee River Redfin in an off stream impoundment (Tuinskloof Dam) is highly relevant for the future survival of the species, but as the impoundment is on privately owned land with limited access control, the introduction of non-native fishes such as Bass species (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) is a significant risk. This risk is also applicable to other non-native species and other dams in the catchment as is illustrated with the illegal introduction of bass into the Tandfontein Dam. This impoundment supplies irrigation water to local farmers and spills into a downstream dam where there is a risk of bass invasion during high flows into the Middeldeur River, the site where there is still a viable section of the Twee subpopulation.<br/>The other major threat is habitat degradation caused primarily by intensive farming of deciduous and citrus fruit. There is over-abstraction of water during the dry summer months and orchards are planted close to the river, resulting in a high likelihood of agrochemical pollution through runoff, spray drift and irrigation return flows. The impacts of pesticides on the Twee System has not been studied to date, but a range of organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids and copper-based fungicides are routinely used. The majority of these chemicals have high toxicities to aquatic fauna and, given the intermittent nature of pesticide application, it is reasonable to expect deleterious effects on resident aquatic fauna such as fish and aquatic invertebrates."

Scat scores at Ludlow National Park and nearby sites revealed a 30-55% site decline between 2002 and 2012 (B. Jones pers. comm). The results of surveys carried out by consultants for developers are generally unavailable; however, anecdotal and observational evidence indicates that other remnant subpopulations have recently undergone significant decline (B.

The major cause of the decline is thought to be climate change (drying and warming) leading to declining food quality: Western Ringtail Possums require relatively high quality food to recruit successfully due to their specialized digestive system. Other implicated factors include continuing habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development, and predation by introduced Red Foxes and feral cats.<br/><br/>Recent (2015) estimates by Dr B.

      "text_habitat": "The Western Ringtail Possum is an arboreal marsupial with a maximum body weight of 1,330 g for both sexes (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a). It formerly occurred in a variety of vegetation types including coastal Peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>) forests and woodlands and Peppermint / Tuart (<em>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</em>) associations, eucalypt associations of Jarrah (<em>E. marginata</em>) / Marri (<em>Corymbia calophylla</em>) / Wandoo (<em>E. wandoo</em>) (Christensen <em>et al</em>. 1985), Wandoo / Casuarina (<em>Allocasuarina huegeliana</em>) woodland in the wheatbelt, and presumably eucalypt woodland, mallee and mallee heath from the Hampton Tableland (Baynes 1987) and other areas. It is now almost exclusively restricted to coastal and near coastal Peppermint woodland between the Australind - Eaton area and Waychinicup National Park (Burbidge and de Tores 1998). The Upper Warren area had the only known sites where Western Ringtail Possums recently persisted in significant numbers in the absence of Peppermint.<br/><br/>In coastal Peppermint habitat, Western Ringtail Possums build dreys as nesting/resting sites and uses tree hollows where available (e.g., Tuart and Marri). Where protection from introduced predators is provided, a wide range of nest sites on or near the ground has been recorded, including low shrub thickets (e.g., Basket Bush (<em>Spyridium globulosum</em>), Orange Wattle (<em>Acacia saligna</em>), Summer-scented Wattle (<em>A. rostellifera</em>)), sedges and rushes (ringtails have been commonly recorded nesting on the ground under sword sedge (<em>Lepidosperma gladiatum</em>) (How <em>et al</em>. 1984, Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994a). In the absence of predator control and in the absence of Peppermint or other nesting/drey material, or where fire is frequent, tree hollows and hollow logs are used almost exclusively, although urban animals will use roof spaces and other shelter. At translocation sites in the Jarrah forest near Dwellingup, where foxes are controlled, 20% of over 400 recorded day rest locations were at or below 1.5 m in height. These sites included hollow logs on the ground, fallen branches and debris on the ground, coppicing jarrah stumps, in and under Grass Tree (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.) leaf \u2018skirts\u2019 and in Water Bush (<em>Bossiaea</em> sp.) and Karri Hazel (<em>Trymalium</em> sp.) In Jarrah forest near Manjimup, where foxes are also controlled, up to 70% of diurnal refuges were sites other than tree hollows, including the skirts of grass trees (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.), stump hollows and hollow logs (Burbidge and de Tores 1998, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>The diet of the Western Ringtail Possum is variable. When available, Peppermint leaves form the majority of the diet. In their absence, the dominant myrtaceous species are preferred (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b). In urban areas (e.g., Bunbury and Busselton), they are known to feed on a variety of garden species, including rose bush leaves and flowers and a variety of fruits. The digestive system reflects adaptation to myrtaceous and other foliage of low nutritional value. Western Ringtail Possums are caecum fermenters having a large caecum where fine digestive material is retained. Larger, coarse, less nutritious material is passed more rapidly. Ringtail Possums are also caecotrophic (i.e., during the day they ingest softer, finer faecal material to assist in returning bacteria to the caecum to aid digestion: Hume and Sakaguchi (1993), Hume <em>et al</em>. (1994)). Successful recruitment depends on seasonal availability of high-quality foliage. When food quality is poor, the sex ratio of young is biased towards males, and recruitment may fail (B. Jones pers. comm). Wayne (2005) reported that 84% of monitored deaths (mostly linked to predation) occurred between April and September, when both male and female body condition was significantly lower than October-March.<br/><br/>Wayne <em>et al</em>. (2006) investigated associations between the relative abundance of the Western Ringtail Possum and anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape scales within the publicly-managed Jarrah forests of south-western Australia. Logging, fire, fox control and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative abundance of ringtails at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha of the Upper Warren east of Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of the Western Ringtail Possum in jarrah forest. Overall, abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local scale, abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. At the landscape scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged; in other words, where logging was historically least intense.<br/><br/>Western Ringtail Possums are often killed in moderate or high intensity fires (Inions 1985) and by logging (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2000). Both impacts also expose survivors to elevated predation. Where most resident possums use predominantly low shelter sites, or dreys in the mid-storey, even low intensity fires can severely reduce numbers. Most resident subpopulations appear to require some substantial or dominant proportion of their local habitat to have remained largely unburned and unlogged for periods of at least 2-4 decades (Wayne 2008, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). By 2012, it was clear that drey-using fragmented subpopulations (in habitat with only rare, small fire events) were more resilient and persistent than subpopulations in habitat subject to broad-scale fire effects (wildfires or low-intensity prescribed fires).<br/><br/>Young have been recorded as being born throughout the year, with peaks in April to July and September to November (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a), but the breeding season can vary. Sexual maturity is reached at about one year. Litter size is usually one, with litters of two being rare, unlike the Common Ringtail Possum (<em>P. peregrinus</em>). Sex ratios can vary, depending on food quality: females predominate when food quality is high, males when it is low. Longevity is unknown. Life spans of <em>P. peregrinus</em> to eight years have been recorded (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1990) and longevity in captivity for that species is up to 10 years (AnAge 2012). Available information suggests that most Western Ringtail Possums do not survive in the wild beyond 3-6 years. Generation length for the Western Ringtail Possum is here assumed to be <em>ca</em> 3 years.", 
      "threats": "<p>Current threats are:</p>  <ol><li>The drying climate, affecting the nutritional quality of food and hence survival and recruitment. Rainfall has declined and continues to decline throughout the south west of Australia. T2014 and 2015 have been the, or close to the, driest on record near Albany. Albany mean rainfall (1877 to 2014): 929 mm; 2014: 638 (no data from December, mean is 30 mm, if 30 mm added = 668 mm); 2015: 621 mm (lowest on record). Busselton mean (1877 to 2014): 813.6 mm; 2014: 591 mm; 2015: 568 mm. Western Ringtail Possums \u2018are among the species most likely to be impacted by predicted climate change in the south-west because they have very specific habitat and dietary requirements, have a poor ability to migrate and have lost large areas of habitat. In addition they are sensitive to drought-induced stress. Over the past 30 years there has been an approximate 20 per cent decline in rainfall in the south-west of WA, with more reductions in rainfall and increased temperatures predicted due to global climate change (Timbal 2004). These changes could result in further contraction of the species to the most fertile and mesic remnants of their extant range (Wayne 2005, Jones and Francesconi 2007)\u2019 (Recovery Plan p. 10). Almost all remaining occurrences are associated with older-growth Peppermint, but few stands now seem to provide suitable nutrition for the species to survive and recruit </li><li>Increasing temperature. \u2018Western Ringtail Possums are known to be susceptible to heat stress and can easily overheat at temperatures of 35\u00b0C (Yin 2006). Western Ringtail Possums have been observed to use evaporative cooling in hot weather by applying saliva to the forelimbs or panting (Jones <em>et al.</em> 1994b). Jones <em>et al</em>. (1994b) observed that in areas where dreys were used, Western Ringtail Possums went to the ground over several hot days. Western Ringtail Possums are the smallest of the specialist marsupial folivores indicating that they live close to the ecological and physiological limits of viability (B. Jones pers. comm. 2002)\u2019 (Recovery Plan pp. 6-7). As well, increasing temperatures exacerbate soil moisture reduction and further affect the nutritional quality of food.</li><li>Land clearing. Land clearing for urban development remains a threat in the Busselton \u2013 Augusta near coastal strip and near Albany. Land clearing continues despite application of the EPBC Act guidelines that aim to assist in determining whether a proposed action is likely to have a significant impact on the Western Ringtail Possum on the southern Swan Coastal Plain. Most remaining habitat is on private land; thus the major land management is via planning controls, not via biodiversity legislation.</li><li>Feral predators. Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats, especially where the canopy becomes more open due to \u2018parkland clearing\u2019 and after fire. Native predators also impact the species.</li><li>Fire. Fire reduces food availability and opens up the canopy causing ringtails to spend more time on the ground where they can be predated by foxes and cats.</li><li>Tree decline and insect outbreaks. Coastal Peppermint decline, gum leaf skeletoniser and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback in Jarrah, Tuart decline and other tree declines have resulted in extensive but mainly localised reductions in food and habitat quality.</li><li>Competition for tree hollows. Increased numbers of Brushtail Possums where fox baiting occurs leads to competition for hollows: brushtails are more aggressive and will evict ringtails. Hollow loss is also caused by logging and feral bees.</li><li>Logging. Western Ringtail Possums are more abundant in unlogged forest or where logging has been least intense; logging leads to local mortality including via increased feral Cat predation. However, current WRP distribution does not now significantly overlap areas to be logged to a significant degree.</li><li>Domestic dogs. \u2018In urban environments predation or injury by domestic dogs can be frequent (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 1998). High levels of dog ownership within the City of Busselton create dog densities at four to eight times greater per hectare than the average fox density in the south-west forests (K. Williams pers. comm. 2006)\u2019 (Recovery Plan, p.8). Ravens are a threat in urban areas where their numbers have increased.</li><li>A plausible future threat is myrtle rust, which significantly affects peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>), in eastern Australia where it is planted horticulturally, noting that peppermint is now the main habitat and food tree for WRPs.</li></ol>  <p>Note that some threats are synergistic.</p>"

The condition of The Dell has deteriorated substantially in recent years due to a combination of factors. The site is isolated on three sides by pasture which limits further colonization and spread of plant species, and leaves the copse exposed to very strong winds which scour the upper parts of High Peak for much of the year. A number of trees have fallen during storms since 2008. This has further opened the canopy, making the site even more vulnerable to tree losses and reducing the ability to trap humidity. The fern layer can be heavily buffeted over winter leaving many fronds ragged. In addition, Tree Ferns appear to be spreading through the understorey, competing directly with the favoured host, Black-Scale Fern, whereas Kikuyu Grass (<em>Pennisetum clandestinum</em> Hochst. ex Chiov.) has encroached onto areas of open ground where light now penetrates.<br/><br/>In response to this critical situation, the Flagship Species Fund (Flora &amp; Fauna International/DEFRA, UK) facilitated an initial study to assess the study to assess the status and ecology of the Spiky Yellow Woodlouse, conducted in 2013 by the St Helena National Trust. Much current understanding of the species\u2019 biology stem from the work undertaken. Subsequently, the Darwin Initiative have supported a further Trust project aimed at species recovery. The principle aims of these current efforts are: (1) to stabilize and expand the area of suitable habitat around the Dell, creating 1 Ha of new Black Cabbage Tree woodland; (2) to establish an <em>ex situ</em> colony of Spiky Yellow Woodlouse for breeding purposes; and (3) to develop a longer term management plan for recovery of the species and its critical habitat.<br/><br/>Ultimately, more areas of extensive Black Cabbage Tree woodland are required around the lower-altitude, sheltered parts of the cloud forest zone, with greater linkages between them. The habitat not only supports the Spiky Yellow Woodlouse, but is also vitally important for the survival of highly threatened epiphytes (e.g. Common and Dwarf Tongue-Ferns, <em>Elaphoglossum conforme</em> (Sw.) Schott and <em>Grammitis ebenina</em> (Maxon) Tardieu), and several specialized invertebrate species (e.g. the Rainbow Leaf Beetle <em>Vernonia wollastoniana</em> White and the endemic spider <em>Tecution mellissii</em> O. P.-Cambridge).<br/><br/>The captive breeding colony will be housed at St Helena Government\u2019s conservation facilities on-island (the \u2018Scotland\u2019 site), and will aim to secure a nucleus of individuals under protected management which can be used to populate an eventual reintroduction programme.",

The actual area of occupied habitat is 621 m<sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy (AOO), based on a 2 km x 2 km grid, is 4 km<sup>2</sup>.

Individuals were found in only two places, separated by 100 m on the steep, south facing cliffs of High Peak. The first (and best known) of these localities lies in a pocket of Black Cabbage Tree woodland known as The Dell. The copse is less than 30 m wide, and even within it the species is highly localized; although a few scattered woodlouse individuals were sporadically found across the entire patch, the major concentration was restricted to a single fern stand spanning only seven by three metres. The second locality was first discovered during an abseil exercise in 2009 (M. Thorsen pers. comm.), but subsequent verification was hampered by the inaccessibility of the site. It lies on a steeply-sloping ledge surrounded by dense cloud forest vegetation, and can only be reached on ropes. The area is smaller than that of The Dell, lying entirely under the canopy of a single large Spoor tree (<em>Pittosporum viridiflorum</em> Sims).<br/><br/>The survey was not entirely comprehensive because numerous parts of the Central Ridge are very steep and some patches of the favoured habitat are extremely difficult to access. Even in those places which were visited, the species can be hard to detect amongst the dense fern swards it frequents. At the time of writing, only a few of the most promising habitat patches have yet to be visited, and it seems reasonably safe to say that substantial subpopulations are unlikely to have been missed.

It generally avoids hairy or scaly hosts such as the Tree Fern (<em>Dicksonia arborescens</em> L\u2019H\u00e9r), and favours the abundant Black-Scale Fern (<em>Diplazium filamentosum</em> (Roxb.) Cronk), but it will also use Brown-Scale Fern (<em>Pseudophagopteris dianae</em> (Hook.) Holttum) and other rarer glabrous species where encountered. Although potentially suitable hosts are widespread amongst upland vegetation, the colonies are apparently restricted to the understorey of heavily shaded woodland. The dominant forest species is almost invariably Black Cabbage Tree (<em>Melanodendron integrifolium</em> (Roxb.) DC.), whose widely-spreading branches and thick, leathery leaves form a dense canopy between three to four metres above the ground. The non-native Spoor is a relatively scarce species at high altitudes, but is structurally similar to Black Cabbage and creates similar micro-habitat conditions at the surviving High Peak colony.<br/><br/>Spiky Yellow Woodlice are clearly well adapted to an \u2018arboreal\u2019 lifestyle. They apparently never descend to the ground but live and feed exclusively amongst the fronds, where long legs and hooked tarsal claws allow them to clamber with agility and cling efficiently to the smooth surfaces. The habitat presents challenges to a crustacean with book lungs which are highly sensitive to desiccation. The extent of the respiratory surface is somewhat limited compared to other woodlice (Taiti <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998), which may be a partial physical adaptation to reduce water loss. However, unlike other terrestrial isopods which hide under stones or amongst soil and leaf litter during dry periods, the elevated foliage provides little opportunity to retreat to crevices in order to conserve moisture. This probably constrains the distribution to the shelter of Black Cabbage canopies, which trap atmospheric moisture particularly effectively. Indeed, within the stand at The Dell, occupied microhabitats correspond well with those parts of the copse where the relative humidity never drops below 90%.<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>Generally diurnal, individuals are active for only short periods when weather conditions are suitable for foraging, and rarely travel far. Few marked specimens strayed more than one metre over several weeks of monitoring, although there is no indication of territoriality and up to six woodlice of mixed sexes occasionally occupied the same frond. During quiescence, they rest on the undersides of the fronds and are somewhat cryptic against the background of foliage. It is not yet clear what the species feeds on but, almost uniquely amongst the ecology of woodlice as currently documented, it does not appear to be a detritivore in the typical sense. The fern swards are usually almost clean of debris and, even when encountered, such potential food sources are usually ignored. During bouts of foraging behaviour, observed specimens tended to halt and press their mouthparts to the substrate at reasonably regular intervals, but the particles they consumed were too small to be obviously seen. It seems likely that they were grazing algae or feeding on fern spores liberated onto the surface, although they do not visit sporangia. They have also been observed consuming a fragment of petal, their own shed exoskeletons and, at a time when Redwood (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em> (G. Forst,) Marais) were planted near The Dell in an earlier attempt at habitat restoration, they regularly attended the flowers to obtain pollen (pers. comm., R. Cairns-Wicks). These combined findings tend to indicate a favoured diet of small, lipid-rich particles.<br/><br/>The age structure of the population suggests that individuals survive for at least two years, perhaps more. In autumn, a continuous size range was recorded, from four to 10.5 mm in length. &#160;At least during their first year, the growing juveniles shed their exoskeletons regularly, perhaps as frequently as once every two weeks. Breeding appears to be restricted to the winter months and only those females above 0.9 mm in length were observed to carry young, which are held under a membrane on the ventral surface of the abdomen known as a marsupium. This parental care ensures a reasonably high rate of survival, but only eight to 10 hatchlings can be accommodated in a brood. The newly-hatched woodlice are approximately 1.0 \u2013 1.5 mm long and do not develop yellow pigmentation for several weeks.", 
      "threats": "It is difficult to determine how extensively the distribution of the Spiky Yellow Woodlouse has declined due to the paucity of historical records. Nineteenth century authors such as Melliss (1875) were unaware of it entirely, which may suggest that the distribution has been confined to few, very restricted and isolated localities for some time. However, despite its striking colour and appearance, this is a remarkably cryptic species which can easily escape detection. The first comprehensive entomological survey of St Helena was conducted by the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren (Belgium) in the 1960s (Basilewsky 1977). They recorded the species only from High Peak. A further detailed study of the Central Peaks in 2005-06 (Mendel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) identified a separate subpopulation near Mt Actaeon (the most northerly of three summits along Diana\u2019s Peak Ridge), and reported additional accounts from locals of the species occurring nearby in Wells\u2019 Gut. More recently, a number of islanders report seeing the Spiky Yellow Woodlice at the head of Byron\u2019s Valley within the past decade (this could conceivably be the same locality as that of Mendel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Other accounts, from the few older residents familiar with the upland forests (also Q. Cronk pers. comm. 2014), describe seeing more general sightings, without specific location. A small subpopulation could possibly have existed at Wash House.<br/><br/>These records provide little more than suggestions, but they are sufficient to at least conclude that the range appears to have contracted substantially in the Diana\u2019s Peak area, where the species could well now be extinct. There can be little doubt that it has also suffered considerable declines from the sites where it has definitely been known at High Peak. At least two accounts describe it as plentiful at The Dell as recently as the late 1990s (R. Cairns-Wicks and V.E. Thomas pers. comm.).&#160;It was recorded in a cave on the north side of High Peak by P. and M. Ashmole in 2005-06. Recent visits found no evidence of continued presence and there appears to be little surrounding habitat to support the species. A further sighting was made in a hollow below The Dell in 2010 (K. Herian and L. Malan pers. comm.), but no individuals could be found here in 2013.&#160;The reasons for the decline are probably complex, but appear to be associated most strongly with the loss of Black Cabbage Tree woodland. As a species, Black Cabbage remains a moderately common component of the cloud forest flora, but stands of several trees growing in close proximity are required to create the dark, humid conditions necessary to support a characteristic understorey community, and these are extremely rare. Although The Dell comprises 25 mature individuals, few other copses of more than three trees survive. Even in areas where there are concentrations of Black Cabbage, the understorey is sometimes dominated by tree ferns, accumulating a heavy, acid leaf litter which smothers the open ground necessary for more diverse herbaceous species to establish.&#160;<br/><br/>It is not clear if, or why, the distribution of Black Cabbage Tree has changed, although several factors could have contributed. The cloud forest zone, which was probably once almost continuous along the Central Ridge, had become heavily depleted as a result of land clearances for pasture by the early 1800s. In the early part of the 20th century, extensive plantations of New Zealand Flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R. Forst. &amp; G. Forst.) were established over the steeper slopes, effectively destroying many of the remaining refuges. It is quite possible that Black Cabbage woodland was particularly affected by this wave of devastation, since it seems to develop most fully in sheltered conditions below the summits, occupying the zone which was almost completely obliterated. Scattered trees survived at higher altitudes, but it may be less able to dominate in such areas, where forced to compete against Tree Ferns and exposed to strong winds.&#160;<br/><br/>Fragments of cloud forest are now confined only to High Peak and the Diana\u2019s Peak range, but even these have been substantially degraded following invasion by numerous non-native plant species. Vigorous competitors such as Whiteweed (<em>Austroeupatorium inulifolium</em> (Kunth) R.M. King &amp; H. Rob., Small Fuchsia (<em>Fuchsia coccinea</em> Curt. in Aiton), Bilberry Tree (<em>Solanum mauritianum</em> Scop.) and Blackberry (<em>Rubus pinnatus</em> Willd.) are noted problems, but other small, ground cover species are likely to have imposed more subtle yet important pressures on the native species. Black Cabbage Tree is a member of the Asteraceae and possesses light, wind-blown seed which requires bare ground to germinate. The native flora contains few low-growing, clonal spreading herbs, and the habitats they occupied would thus would have originally contained plenty of gaps. The arrival of pasture grasses and the introduced Feather Moss (<em>Pseudoscleropodium purum</em> (Hedw.) Fleisch in Broth.) have increasingly removed openings, resulting in more limited germination opportunities for endemic trees. These changes may have further influenced the ability of Black Cabbage to form continuous clusters. There are concerns that this dominant component of the upland forests is declining (Lambdon and Ellick 2015), and, in particular, that further habitat losses will become apparent as the current older cohort dies.<br/><br/>In addition to the long term deterioration in habitat quality, the Spiky Yellow Woodlouse faces other important threats. Habitat fragmentation undoubtedly imposes major limitations on the ability to recover. The species appears to be highly sedentary and since it is confined to the fern layer, can presumably only normally travel by clambering from one frond to another. A gap of only a few metres thus imposes severe constraints on dispersal. Meanwhile, under the highly dynamic successional processes operating in St Helena\u2019s cloud forest, any individual habitat patch is unlikely to persist for no more than a few decades. The combined pressures could result in a high rate of local extinction.<br/><br/>The impacts of predators and diseases are less certain. Numerous invertebrate threats (e.g. the Woodlouse Spider, <em>Dysdera crocata</em> C.L. Koch) have been introduced to St Helena, although the recent study did not record any incidences of losses to them and few potential antagonists were noted. Rats and Mice (<em>Rattus rattus</em> L., <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> Berkenhout and <em>Mus musculus</em> L.) are prevalent near The Dell, but are unlikely to present an acute threat as they are too heavy to climb onto the fern fronds.&#160;Occasional predation by African Grass Frog (<em>Strongylopus grayi</em> Smith) is another consideration, and a few individuals have been heard calling in the area. This introduced amphibian was not seen near the main colony area&#160;during&#160;repeated day and night searches in 2013, but its distribution and potential impacts require further research."

It has also, though, been found in secondary woodland and occurs in degraded woodland (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, including dead juniper habitat. It is shy, elusive and occurs in small parties in dense vegetation (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>, hence it is not recorded in dead or dying juniper habitats which are more open (Bealey and Rayaleh 2006)<strong></strong>. The presence of a population in the Mabla Mountains, where juniper is effectively absent, may indicate that habitat structure rather than species composition of woodland may be a key ecological factor (Welch <em>et al. </em>2009a)<strong></strong>. A detailed survey in the For\u00eat du Day suggested that the presence of closed-canopy forest may be more important to the species than juniper health (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). It feeds on seeds, berries and termites, and also figs from the forest edge (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. The breeding season is from December to February (McGowan 1994)<strong></strong>. It is probably monogamous, laying a clutch of 5-7 eggs; the only known nest was a shallow grass-lined depression on an inaccessible mountain ledge (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>", 
      "threats": "At For\u00eat du Day, juniper woodland is in poor condition, with virtually all trees dead or dying by now. The reasons for this are unclear, but the high level of grazing by cattle, camels and goats is certainly a problem in much of the woodland, possibly exacerbated by acid rain, climate change and fungal disease (Magin 2001). Most local people (57%) interviewed in the For\u00eat du Day attribute high juniper mortality to drought (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in 2007 showed that in areas of high tree cover or poor juniper condition, the presence of <em>P</em><em>. ochropectus</em> was negatively correlated with grazing intensity, especially that of cattle (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). Within 18 months of the restoration of an exclosure, juniper seedlings (which were non-existent elsewhere) were found to be frequent under living juniper trees, suggesting grazing has indeed been the main cause of the decline of the forest (Ford 2008)<strong></strong>. Other concerns include collection of firewood on lower slopes (Magin 2001), hunting, egg harvesting (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and human disturbance (G. R. and H. J. Welch <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. At Mabla, there are signs of significant human disturbance in the remaining stands of woodland, which have been heavily exploited for firewood and grazing (Magin 2001). Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International <em>unpubl. data</em>)<strong></strong>. <p></p>"

Crowley pers. comm.). A loss of 21-50% was estimated to have occurred over the period 1970-2000 (an average annual rate of 1.2% spiny forest loss; Harper <em>et al</em>. 2007), and a further loss of 51-80% of remaining habitat was projected for the period 2002-2012 (CBSG 2001). Invasive plant species affecting habitat suitability were considered a significant threat at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG 2001).<br/> <br/>In addition, the species has increasingly become subject to collection for the local food trade as Radiated Tortoise populations have been depleted, and exploitation has recently included harvesting for livers for export to Asia (Behler 2000). A pulse of legal export trade occurred during the period 2000-2004; CITES trade records show that about 4,000 animals were exported for the international pet trade in that time (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Pyxis arachnoides</em> was recommended to be listed as Endangered (A3acd, B1b) at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG, 2001).<br/><br/>Overall, the northern subspecies <em>P.a. brygooi</em> is under more severe habitat loss and exploitation pressures than the other two subspecies, with some <em>brygooi</em> subpopulations already extirpated and others declining.<br/><br/>The 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) workshop (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007) evaluated different threat and population scenarios, which variously yielded estimates of about 60 to 80 years of decline into extinction based on harvest rates of 2005.

The fledging of nearly 500 broods of one to three young each in the Central Panay Mountain Range was the consequence of this nest-protection scheme (Hembra <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2006) and the aim is to expand nest protection into more southerly parts of the CPMR (E.

The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;</p><p>Firstly, overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-uni- effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970\u20132015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\">.&#160;Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to calculate reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 in 1981\u20131983 to 0.060 in 2013\u20132015.</p><p>Secondly, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with steep declines to the point of local disappearance in some places.

      "threats": "Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distribution. Guitarfishes&#160;are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the&#160;<span style=\"\">Spineback Guitarfish,&#160;</span>and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the region.<br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d\u2019Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style=\"\">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977\u00ad\u20132000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950\u20132010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under \u2018access agreements\u2019 that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China\u2019s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (<span lang=\"EN-US\">Guti\u00e9rrez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).&#160;</p><p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">C\u00f4te d'Ivoire</span>&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).</p>"

      "threats": "Snub-nosed Monkeys are threatened by direct and indirect hunting pressures. Animals are hunted and trapped for their bones and heads, but most often monkeys are unintentionally trapped in iron traps that are set to trap deer or wild pigs to supply the local bush meat trade (this has been confirmed by local hunters and there is camera trap evidence of the monkeys travelling on the ground where traps have been set) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Already with the still limited construction work camps, commercial bush meat demand  has increased sharply over the last two years (2010-2011) and is set to accelerate (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Monkeys may also be caught in traps set for bears (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation, due to the creation of roads and other infrastructure is rapidly becoming a major threat. Logging roads have now been built into all the areas occupied by this species since 2009 (some are within 200 m of the camera traps) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). With the increased access, the influx of Chinese workers to the area as part of the logging and dam building operations is accelerating and it is expected that when the dams reach the full construction stage there will be at least 10,000 workers employed in this area (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat loss due the impacts of logging is very serious due to large scale mechanical logging (blasting of logging roads, use of heavy equipment and winches, reaching ridges and even peaks) taking place, especially as the largest part of the range area is conifer forest and during the snow-covered winter months the Snub-nosed Monkeys (just as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">R. bieti</span>) depend on lichens for food (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). As the logging is effecting most mature conifer trees, food sources especially in winter are becoming scarce. The logging practices are causing serious destruction because logging takes place at high altitudes and even on slopes with more than 70 degrees slope inclination (these areas are accessed using winches and roads are blasted through cliffs). Land slides are becoming increasingly common as a result of the loss of tree cover. The&#160; lower mountain broad leaf forest is also impacted by logging (targeting hardwoods) and landslides caused by logging roads. Shifting cultivation reaches from the N'mai Hka river valley up to 2,000 meters, flooding following dam construction will displace shifting cultivation areas in the valley bottom to higher areas, increasing the pressures on the Snub-nosed Monkey habitat (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<p><span lang=\"EN-IN\">At present, the conservation status of the monkey in China remains unclear. Hunting&#160;remains a threat as understood from the hunting tools in use in the community around the habitat. In one instance, <em>R. strykeri</em> was reared as pet.</p><p>Given the various projects coming up in the species\u2019 range, and based on the ongoing (over the last 10 years) and increasing levels of hunting and habitat loss, it is suspected that the species will undergo rapid declines of over 80% in the future, especially then next 30-35 years.</p>"

However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The African Wedgefish is however the only <em>Rhynchobatus</em> species occurring in the Eastern Atlantic, and is easily separable from the False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) with which it occurs in Mauritania.<br/><br/>While no time-series are available for the African Wedgefish, it is known to have disappeared from a significant part of West Africa (Mauritania to Sierra Leone but apparently with the exception of the Banc d'Arguin National Park; Diop and Dossa 2011). However, the species is now sparsely reported in the Banc d'Arguin National Park with only two individuals recorded in the past decade during fish landing site monitoring (the most recent record being February 2019) (Sa\u00efkou Oumar&#160;Kid\u00e9, pers. comm. 14/02/19,&#160;Sall Amadou,&#160;pers. comm. 14/02/19).&#160;This species was moderately abundant across its former range in the 1960s but declined thereafter (Bernard S\u00e9ret, pers. comm., 07/02/19). During Guinean trawl surveys in the 1960s, catch rates were as high as 30-34 kg/hr (William 1968). Recent fish market surveys across the region have either failed to locate it, or found only low numbers of individuals. In The Gambia, annual surveys since 2010 of landing sites that regularly land guitarfishes and other batoids have not recorded the species (Moore 2017). In one artisanal demersal gillnet fishery in Mayumba, Gabon (between 30 to 40 boats), surveys between&#160;February 2013 and October 2015 identified 40 individuals, and surveys between May and October 2018 identified 5 individuals (Godefroy de Bruyne,&#160;pers. comm.,&#160;14/09/18). Observers on board national trawlers off Gabon have not recorded the species in monitoring which commenced in 2015, despite many species of rays being recorded (Emmanuel Chartrain, pers. comm.,&#160;15/02/19). In Port Gentil, Gabon (around 400 boats), where rays are targeted, the African Wedgefish has not been seen during ongoing surveys which commenced in June 2017 (Godefroy de Bruyne,&#160;pers. comm.,&#160;14/09/18).&#160;A 2006 capture by a recreational fishing guide in Guinea-Bissau was reportedly described as 'very, very rare' (Moore 2017). There is a recent photographic record from Sao Tom\u00e9 Island (Reiner and Wirst 2016).<br/><br/>In the Indo-West Pacific (outside of the range of the African Wedgefish), there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates (non species-specific) which can be used to infer population reduction, and these can be considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly where they are under heavy exploitation (see the Supplementary Information). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p><br/>These historical accounts and datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)&#160;(recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018a, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p><br/>Fishing pressure (\u2018actual levels of exploitation\u2019) is high and increasing across the range of the African Wedgefish (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines as outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific have not occurred in West Africa (in fact the species has reportedly disappeared from a large part of the region and captures are now rare; Diop and Dossa 2011). This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins. It is inferred that the African Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.</p>",

      "rationale": "The African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) is a large (to ~300 cm total length) shark-like ray which is widespread off West Africa in the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 35 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the African Wedgefish has litter sizes of 2\u20135 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years. The \u2018white\u2019 fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes) are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population reduction has been inferred for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger wedgefish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, the African Wedgefish was considered to be moderately abundant in the 1960s, but it is now only sporadically observed in landing site surveys. It is inferred that the African Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.",

      "threats": "<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure in West Africa with a long history of artisanal and industrial fishing. As a result, demersal coastal fisheries resources are considered overexploited in significant areas of the region (e.g., FAO 2018b).<br/><br/>Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Diop and Dossa 2011); the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006), and no doubt occurs more widely. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species (Tous<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1998, Diop and Dossa 2011).<br/><br/>Several countries across the range of the African Wedgefish are significant fishing nations with high levels of fishing pressure on the marine environment (including Mauritania, Senegal, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Ghana). Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century: in 1950 there were 125 pirogues (small fishing boats), in the 1980s there were &lt;750, in the late 1990s there were &gt;2,500, and in 2005 there was nearly 4,000 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Furthermore, the industrial fleet is significant with 172 vessels (mostly trawlers) licensed to fish in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2015 (ONS 2017). Similarly, the number of artisanal pirogues in Senegal rose from ~5,000 in 1982 to &gt;9,000 in 2003 and 12,699 in 2006, although it has since fallen slightly to 11,889 in 2013 (FAO 2008, ANSD 2016).

The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, with India passing further legislation in 2008 banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use'<strong> </strong><strong></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In October 2010, the government of Bangladesh banned the production of  diclofenac for use in cattle, and the distribution and sale of the drug  were due to be outlawed during the first half of 2011 (M.M.H. Khan<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>. While these bans have been introduced and have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures in South Asia) levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span> 2011a,b). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011c). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2006, Swarup <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2007). Awareness-raising work has been carried out in Nepal to highlight the use of alternatives to diclofenac (Subedi 2013).<br/><br/>Searches for breeding sites in Nepal have proved successful, and these have been combined with outreach activities (Dhakal <em>et al. </em>2014). Monitoring of vultures has been conducted in a number of protected areas in India, and monitoring of vulture populations combined with supplementary feeding is underway in the northern and eastern plains of Cambodia. There are currently seven vulture restaurants in Cambodia, which are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project, a partnership between the Royal Cambodian Government and national and international NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Advocacy to reduce the use of poisons and poisoned bait to catch fish and waterfowl has succeeded in reducing the number of vultures being poisoned accidentally (S. Mahood <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt.</span> 2012). A five-year captive breeding and reintroduction scheme to be run by the Zoological Park Association and Kasetsart University was due to begin in 2007 in Uthai Thani, Thailand (Anon 2007)<strong></strong>, but captive breeding efforts are not as advanced as they are for Critically Endangered <em>Gyps</em> vultures and these are urgently needed. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by research into the locations of nesting colonies, causes of vulture deaths and potential that diclofenac was being used in livestock (Eames 2007a). Further research on the causes of decline in this species was being proposed in 2011 (R. Cuthbert <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in litt</span>. 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen<span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, DNPWC 2015, SAVE 2015).<br/><br/>An action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2006 (Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests 2006), but has not been updated. Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh (MoEF 2016). A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian Vultures is under development and is due to be considered by CMS at COP12 in October 2017.<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify action required to prevent extinction. Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Continue to carry out public awareness and public support programmes. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities that have been implemented in Cambodia in Myanmar. Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses,&#160;where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres. Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternatives to diclofenac. Test other NSAIDs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, SAVE 2014).

Declines in the Indian Subcontinent have followed widely reported and well-researched declines in <em>Gyps</em> vultures owing to mortality following ingestion of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat livestock, and it is hypothesised that this same drug has been responsible for the observed trends in Red-headed Vulture in the region. Census results from Cambodia suggest that the population there has been stable since 2004 at least (Eames 2007b). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia, and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the main reasons behind its decline in this region are thought to be accidental poisoning (through hunting), capture for traditional medicine, the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013)<strong></strong>. Given its rarity in South-East Asia, it is unlikely that more than a few hundred individuals remain there, while the total population seems unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals given the patchiness of its distribution across India and the apparently catastrophic very recent declines.<em> </em><p></p>",

Vultures play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India. <p></p>", 
      "threats": "The disappearance of vultures from Asia is linked to a suite of factors: notably the demise of wild ungulates (Clements<em> et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>, the intensification of agriculture, increased sophistication of waste disposal techniques, direct persecution and disease. However, rapid declines since the turn of the 21st century are believed to have been driven by the pharmaceutical NSAID diclofenac used to treat livestock, which has proven highly toxic to vultures, causing mortality from renal failure that results in visceral gout (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. A recent study found that Red-headed Vulture population declines in India had slowed and were possibly increasing following a ban on diclofenac, which suggests that the species is also adversely affected by the drug (Galligan <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Surveys in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007 found no evidence that diclofenac was being used in livestock (Eames 2007a) and it is not in use in Cambodia (Mahood<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in litt</span>. 2012). A range of other NSAIDs (aclofenac [a pro-drug of diclofenac], ketoprofen, nimesulide and flunixin) have also now been found to be toxic to vultures&#160;(Naidoo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000\u2013232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka </a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">). Demand for seafood in Japan, and Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5 kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019a). </a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\"></a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">Although the high demand may lead to an increase in imports, it is assumed that it is also leads to ongoing pressure on domestic fisheries which in turn leads to ongoing threats to the Japanese Angleshark.</a></p><p><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (</a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014</a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">).</a><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\">  </a></p>  <p><a name=\"_Hlk22884500\"></a></p>The Yellow Sea was once one of the most intensively exploited Large  Marine Ecosystems in the world and is considered severely impacted  in terms of overfishing, with destructive fishing practices (NOAA  2009). In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the \u2018fishing down\u2019 effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 (~2,000% increase) in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world\u2019s farmed fish (FAO 2019c<strong>, </strong>Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019c, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (~350<a name=\"_Hlk20734780\">\u2013</a>500% increase) (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283\u2013239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=\"_Hlk20734780\">\u2013</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<a name=\"_Hlk21696013\"> </a>Small individuals of the Japanese Angelshark that are not used for human consumption would be used for fish meal.</p>  Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include dramatic habitat loss in the region. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). This may impact the inshore component of the species range."

It is also close to extinction, if not already \"functionally extinct\", on Masbate, where the species was last confirmed in 1993, at which time only a few individuals were reported to survive in one location. Consequently, potentially viable populations now survive only in the last remaining forest fragments on Negros and Panay Islands (collectively comprising <em>c</em>a 6% and &gt;4% of land area, respectively).

Two subspecies are currently recognized, i.e.  the nominate form from Cebu (now extinct) and <em>negrinus</em> from Negros; though recent MtDNA studies have indicated the likely addition of a third subspecies from Panay (Tomowo Ozawa pers. comm. and in prep).",

It can persist in some degraded habitats such as cogon grasslands as long as there are areas of dense cover, though there is some evidence to suggest that pigs surviving in largely denuded areas are predominately composed of feral animals of mixed origin (W. Oliver pers. comm).", 
      "threats": "All of the few remaining populations of these animals are now widely fragmented and declining; both through former widespread commercial logging operations, continued low-level illegal logging and agricultural expansion (particularly slash-and-burn cultivation or \"kaingin\"), and hunting pressure. The latter continues throughout its remaining range, both by local farmers in hinterland communities and recreational hunters from larger cities. Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat which usually commands at least twice the price of domestic pork in local markets and speciality restaurants. Efforts to reduce or discourage hunting are unfortunately also often compromised by generally negative attitudes towards these animals, which can cause severe damage to crops planted within or close to existing forest boundaries, and which are therefore regarded as pests and, hence, a legitimate target for hunting activities (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 1993). Unfortunately, this species is also threatened by genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic and feral animals of ex-<em>Sus scrofa</em> origin, and hybrids have been confirmed from almost all remaining population sites (Blouch 1995; Oliver 1995, 2001)."

The current volume is 1.3 billion m\u00b3 (Living Lakes 2005), therefore Lake Chapala's volume has reduced by 84% in approximately 35 years.  81% of the Lake Chapala catchment area is used for agriculture and the portion of irrigated areas quintupled in the last 50 years (Living Lakes 2005). Additionally, these dams restrict the migration of juveniles from small streams and tributaries into the lake (Lyons<em> et al</em>. 1994, O.

Contamination of the water that supplies the lake has reached alarming levels, to the degree of causing toxicological mutations in some of the fish species that until now have survived in the vast lake.  Among the problems are the high levels of phosphorus (80 times higher than is permitted by the international standards), infestation of algae, presence of heavy metals (cyanide chromium, leads and mercury) and infestation of aquatic weeds (eutrophication).

Classified as Critically Endangered and listed as a Top 25 Endangered Primate since 2000.<br/><br/>Since November 2000,&#160;<em>T. poliocephalus</em>&#160;and its habitat on Cat Ba have been the subject of the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project (implemented by the M\u00fcnster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations, ZGAP, currently administered by Zoo Leipzig), which has been focused on the improvement of protection status for the species and its habitat, and has initiated two important programs. The first is a langur sanctuary located inside Cat Ba National Park and a \"buffer zone\" of the World Heritage Site \"Halong Bay\". Fifty-eight percent of the remaining population lives in the sanctuary. The second is a Langur-guarding program that is meant to protect 42% of the population that exists elsewhere in the national park. This program puts the subpopulations and their ranges under joint control of the national park and local people who patrol the ranges and offer community conservation education. The most important steps in the recovery of this subspecies now are continued protection from encroachment, a reduction in the habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation, and an increase in reproductive output and genetic health of the entire population, suggesting the need for translocation and meta-population management, including the ex-situ population. Poaching of the Langurs specifically appears to have completely stopped on Cat Ba with the last confirmed incident in 2001, although the threat remains and the drop in population in early 2016 raises the possibility that poaching by non-local people is experiencing a revival.<br/><br/>A few <em>T. poliocephalus</em> are held in the collection of the Endangered Primate Rescue Center, Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam (Nadler 1999), numbering five individuals at time of writing, coming from only two founders.<br/><br/>Some of the recommended interventions are connecting populations across sites and designing management plans for the small captive population (Lees <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",

Records indicate that in 2003 the count was 40 confirmed animals, reaching 48 by 2010, and 56 by early 2014 (Leonard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Exact counts are difficult as some groups remain in inaccessible areas and are rarely seen.<br/><br/>Previous population counts were not given at a regular time on the year, resulting in the appearance of a much greater fluctuation in population than is actually the case.&#160;&#160;A January 01 population count from 2001-2019 based on CBLCP records removes some variation in previous population counts: 2000 47; 2001 47; 2002 40; 2003 40; 2004 40; 2005 43; 2006 46; 2007 47; 2008 48; 2009 49; 2010 48; 2011 50; 2012 49; 2013 53; 2014 56; 2015 59; 2016 53; 2017 55; 2018 57; 2019 60 (CBLCP unpublished information).

Movement observations in 2014 and 2015 indicate that at least two of the previously recorded seven subpopulations should be considered as a single subpopulation.<br/><br/>Despite the decline in the number of subpopulations the over-all population numbers are on the rise, with a brief down-turn in 2015. Group size averages 5.9 to 6.5 animals, based on the October 2019 population of 67 individuals in 10-11 groups. Within each subpopulation some groups are single sex and there are several cases of solitary animals, usually male.&#160;&#160;Average population growth is 2-3% per year with year-by-year variation from -10% to +8% (CBLCP unpublished information).<br/><br/>The population declined to an estimated 500-600 langurs in 1970-1986 from an estimated 2,400-2,700 langurs that appears to have thrived in the \u2018optimal\u2019 karst habitat (Nadler and Long 2000). The population declined further in 1999-2000 by 50% or more from 104-135 individuals to 40-53 individuals.<br/><br/>Phan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported a population of 50-60 individuals on Cat Ba Island, in 12 groups of 4.67 individuals and through simulation studies predict an increase to 86 individuals in 2050. A more recent PVA (Lees <em>et al</em>., 2014) indicates a best guess increase in population to 200-300 individuals by 2050.&#160;The October 2019 population of 67 individuals is divided into 10-11 groups, including solitary animals and a bachelor male group, with an average group size of 5.9-6.5 individuals.&#160;Attempted male take-overs resulting in group fragmentation and reforming accounts for the variability in group number and size&#160;<span class=\"None\">(Neahga Leonard in litt., 31 October 2019).</span><br/><br/>The 2014 PVA (Lees <em>et al</em>.) calculated extinction risks in two sites across the island and one off the island: The Sanctuary, Cua Dong, and the captive population at the Cuc Phuong National Park. The analyses showed a moderate extinction risk for the first population i.e. the Sanctuary with a 10.6% risk of extinction in the worst case scenario or \u2018pessimistic\u2019 case over 100 years. The Cua Dong population was most at risk with a 40.5% risk of extinction at the worst case scenario over 100 years. The low reproductive rate and low carrying capacity of the site increase the probability of extinction. The captive population ran a very high extinction risk of 100% in the worst case and 95% in the best case (or \u2018optimistic\u2019) over 50 years, owing to the susceptibility of the population to inbreeding and due to small population size.<br/><br/>Births per year have been steadily increasing, with approximately 30% of the reproductively active females giving birth per year from 2014 until present (2019) except for 2016. A concurrent increase in infant mortality has been recorded, the majority of which have been linked with infanticide during male take-over attempts.&#160;&#160;This combined with the current lack of predators on Cat Ba indicates that the primary cause of infant deaths is likely to be infanticide&#160;<span class=\"None\">(Neahga Leonard in litt., 31 October 2019).</span><br/><br/>From 2014 to October 2019 infant mortality has averaged 22%, but is highly variable on a year-by-year level, ranging from 13% to 36%.&#160;&#160;Infant mortality averaged over the years the CBLCP has been active, 2000-present (2019) is 16% with a variation ranging from 0% to 36% on individual years&#160;<span class=\"None\">(Neahga Leonard in litt., 31 October 2019).</p>",

The caves found in this habitat are thought to offer protection from predators and temperature extremes but, if accessible to people, this habitat is also where human hunters capture or kill sleeping Langurs (Nadler <em>et al</em>., 2003). It is arboreal and terrestrial, and diurnal and mildly crepuscular. Like other Langurs, this species is mainly folivorous, with leaves making up between 75-87% of its diet; the rest is composed of fruit, flowers, and stems (Hendershott <em>et al.,</em>&#160;in prep.). Forty-two families of plants with 98 plant species have been reported to constitute their diet. Social composition is unimale-multifemale groups with and, despite the small number of animals remaining, bachelor bands composed of several males have been identified (Luu Tuong Bach and Le Van Dung, 2013). Home range is estimated to be <em>ca</em> 30\u201350 ha.

      "threats": "<p><span class=\"None\">Poaching, primarily for traditional \"medicine\" with secondary hunting for sport has been recognized as the most severe historical threat to Cat Ba Langurs, and the reason for the precipitous decline in their population over the past decades (Nadler and Long, 2000). Reproductively valuable males were often the most common victims due to their behavior (Stenke and Chu Xuan Canh, 2004).&#160;This is highly questionable, however,&#160;as their behaviour is not enormously different and, if anything, females would be easier to hunt as they are often grouped together and there are more of them per group (Leonard Neahga in litt., 31 October 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for meat seems to have happened rarely due to the reputed poor taste of langur meat.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and fragmentation resulting from the growing human population on Cat Ba Island (due in large part to the country's designation of the island as a new tourism center for northern Viet Nam), and rampant fires due to honey collectors (Nadler and Long, 2000) are also threats.<br/><br/>Poorly regulated tourism in the inadequately managed Cat Ba National Park has direct effects on langur natural history, such as the disturbance to habitat in the karst archipelago where these monkeys live. The small size and fragmented nature of the remaining Cat Ba Langur population means that the species is at risk of inbreeding effects (or intrinsic effects to avoid inbreeding by not breeding at all), extremely limited mate-choice due to the small number of available females, and the chance of a natural or human disaster causing total or effective extinction. However, according to&#160;Leonard Neahga (in litt., 31 October 2019) the population would have been very small even at its peak, and would have been small for the last 12,000 years when the langurs were confined to Cat Ba as a result of rising sea levels. It is unlikely that the population was ever above 4-5,000 individuals at any point over the last 12,000 years.&#160;This suggests that major inbreeding effects would have already happened in the deep past and, potentially, been weeded out.&#160;The threat of disease remains a major concern.<br/><br/>The presence of a group of non-native macaques on a nearby tourist island that have extensive daily contact with humans is a cause for concern due to the potential of escape and disease transmission. &#160;</p>"

Despite much research, very few inter-fragment movements have been recorded (Waiyaki and Samba 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers well-shaded areas with a dense understorey, high litter-cover and little or no herbaceous cover (Waiyaki and Samba 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and consequently is found at greater density in Mbolobo, the least disturbed forest area, and is rarest in Chawia, which has a more open canopy and a very shrubby understorey (Brooks 1997, Waiyaki and Samba 2000, Waiyaki <em>et al. </em>2001)<strong></strong>. It rarely ascends more than 2 m above ground (Zimmerman <em>et al</em>. 1996), although nests can be up to 10m high (L. Borghesio <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At certain times of the year its diet is predominantly fruit, but it will also eat invertebrates (Brooks 1997, L. Borghesio <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is monogamous and terrestrial, with overlapping home ranges (Waiyaki and Samba 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and breeding between January and July (although this may be variable as limited data from work in the region in 2000 and 2015 suggest breeding September to March [Samba <em>&#160;et al. </em>2003,&#160;L. Borghesio <em>in litt. </em>2016]). The clutch-size is 1-3 (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

      "threats": "Most indigenous forest has been cleared in the Taita Hills for cultivation or reforestation with non-native timber, and the remaining tiny area is under serious threat from both clearance and degradation (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 1998, Mulwa 1998, L. Bennun <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, and the low connectivity of patches can be a problem for this species (Aben <em>et al. </em>2012). However, habitat quality in the largest two forest fragments remains good (Waiyaki and Samba 2000, Rogers <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008)<strong></strong>. A highly male-biased sex ratio in Chawia (only 10% of birds were female) might have significant negative consequences for the subpopulation's long-term survival (Lens <em>et al.</em> 1998, Waiyaki and Samba 2000, Waiyaki <em>et al. </em>2001)<strong></strong>. The species's reproductive rate may thus be lower than expected (Lens <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Inbreeding is a concern due to a lack of movement of individuals between forest fragments (Collar 2005). Where habitat disturbance leads to deteriorations in body condition, the long-term survival of sub-populations may be put at risk (Lens <em>et al.</em> 2001,<em>&#160;</em>2002). Other threats include fire, growing evidence of high rates of nest predation (L. Borghesio <em>in litt. </em>2016),&#160;and climate change.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span><strong><sup><p></p></sup></strong>"

These were first introduced into the lake in the 1950's to increase commercial fish production, but have now become the most common fish in the lake. The introduction of tilapia is thought to have led to the near extinction of indigenous fish species and mussels in the lake through competition and direct predation. The lake is also threatened by the expansion of agricultural land and human disturbance and livestock grazing at the lake banks, which modify the lake ecosystem through changes in turbidity and sedimentation (Annawaty <em>et al.</em> 2016). Water quality declines due to domestic runoff may also be occurring (J. Sulfani Udin pers. comm. 2019).
