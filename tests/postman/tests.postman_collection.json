Effective population size for cheetahs (females in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park) was estimated at 44% of the census population (incorporating variability in lifetime reproductive success: Kelly 2001).  The census population of cheetahs in Iran is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al</em>., 2007), with less than half likely to consist of mature breeding individuals.<br/><br/>Although the population currently appears stable (Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2007), it has declined in recent decades.  There were said to be over 200 Cheetahs in Iran in the mid-1970s (E. Ferouz, pers. comm. 1974), although some experts consider this figure an over-estimate (P. Joslin, pers. comm.)

The type locality of <i>A. j. venaticus</i> (=<i>Felis venatica</i> [Griffith, 1821]) is unknown (Krausman and Morales 2005).  At a November 2006 meeting of the North African Region Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG), Belchabir (2007) recommended genetic studies to clarify whether the cheetahs of Algeria (which probably has the largest Saharan cheetah population) should be classified as <i>A. j. hecki</i> or <i>A. j. venaticus</i>.
